# Notes

## Workshop practices / methodology

* Start the workshop _on time_. Starting each day with intros/goals allows some to
  arrive late without being disruptive.
* Twila likes concentrating exercises / group work on day 3.
* "Group project" theme throughout?
* Pre-identify some possible datasets for groups that don't find any ideas.
* Consider non-substantial "homework"; e.g. ...?
* Share workshop goals in advance of the application process.
* Be clear in advance that we're going to create mixed-skill groups. (You can learn and
  teach [and learn by teaching]!)
* Prepwork activity in advance of day 1: Think of datasets that interest you!


## Introductions

### Talk about configuration of groups

We tried to mix up skill levels. **Encourage peer learning.**


### Twila: Quirky icebreaker question could be related to the workshop

Could use some of these in person, some could be part of the prompt for the in-advance
intros.

* Dream place you want to go in Greenland
* A dataset you'd love to use with QGreenland
* Tell a story about Greenland
* Convey a data-related challenge from your past
* Think of Greenland datasets you're interested in working with
* ...?


## Content

* Start every day with "Goals for today"
* For Day 1 activity with JupyterHub, ensure there's interaction with QGreenland
    * E.g. process ocean temps raster into contours
* Day 1 EOD reflection: Provide some direction; e.g. ask a question that preps for Day
  2?
* Day 2 foundational concepts review: Pick out example QGreenland datasets for each type
  of data. These concepts were introduced in the beginner tutorials, but not in depth
  discussing e.g. continuous vs categorical data.
* How do we use breakout groups on Day 2?
* Activity: Identify 1-3 datasets you want to use in QGreenland, e.g. browse Arctic Data
  Portal, share own dataset.
* Activity: With your group, evaluate a dataset against FAIR principles (after choosing
  a dataset in a prior activity)
* End each day with a breakout group activity
* Activity: On Day 3, revisit dataset chosen earlier and do some processing of
  data/metadata. E.g. improve FAIRness, join with an existing QGreenland dataset
* End Day 3 with presenting Jupyter Notebooks?
