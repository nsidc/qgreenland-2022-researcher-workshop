# Review notes

## Alyse sticky notes

### Identified 4 themes

* Open science
* Data quality
* Geospatial analysis
* Data visualization / presentation

#### Notes

* Order of themes makes sense, builds on itself.
* If we need to cut a theme, suggests visualization.
* Timing ideas:
    * Consider two-hour breaks each day, with one hour of office hours? Pushes the end
      of workshop 1 hour later, e.g. 6pm Greenland time?
    * Consider 1-hour office hours after each workshop?
* Icebreaker:
    * Prefers "Story about Greenland"; what if an attendee has never been? Maybe a story
      about your connection with Greenland?
* Breakout: Select and analyze a dataset
    * Concerned about spending too much time choosing;
    * Can send out a message to all breakout rooms after 3-4 minutes saying "You should
      have chosen a dataset by now, please proceed to other tasks!"
* Going in and out of breakout rooms has a ~5 minute cost.
* Can we set up timed breakout rooms? Or e.g. a 2-minute warning before the activity is
  over?
* Can we assign individuals to breakout rooms and auto-send everyone with a single
  click? What's this look like?
* "Working in the open": Common concern about being "scooped" before publication.
  Discuss the realities; how often does that happen? What protections do you have?
    * License as a safety mechanism. What licenses can we recommend that protect
      research products?
    * Is this a "modern" concern?
* Ask Alyse for photo backgrounds, or steal from QGreenland website


#### TODO

* ~~Intro to Jupyter feels out of place on 2nd day. Can we move to first day?~~
* Consider videos in advance of workshop: GitHub and JupyterHub.
* ~~Can we make an exercise to "smoke test" JupyterHub setup?~~
* Include timing for each slide in presenter notes
* ~~Community guidelines: Steal from Alyse!~~
    * Expectations for how to use Zoom
    * Be up-front about use of breakout rooms
    * Behavior guidelines
* ~~Pre-workshop checklist~~
