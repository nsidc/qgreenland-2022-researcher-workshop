# Post-workshop TODO

## Jupyter blog post

* Start a post on a collaborative platform (HackMD, Google Docs), and invite Yuvi Panda
  to edit after we've got a first draft. We can contact Yuvi on Openscapes Slack.


## Review deliverables

* What are some interesting:
    * Notebooks
    * Discussions posts (specifically FAIR/CARE)
        * Include word cloud


## Workshop website updates

* Add a "this workshop is completed" notice to front page (info / warning box?)
* Thank attendees for their high quality participation


### Remove OBE content

* Remove links to application materials
* Cross out workshop dates and replace with a completion message


### New "Outcomes" top-level nav

* Thank participants for an awesome workshop
* Highlight deliverables (see previous section)
* Link to our blog post
* Link to Hacker News post


### Lessons learned

_Should this be in the admin space, or the outcomes space?_

* Overall impressions
* Changes we'd want to make
* Tips and tricks for running workshop
    * Let people join their own breakout rooms; trying to predict what e-mail people
      will join Zoom with and pre-configuring breakout rooms turned out to be a time
      sink. Inevitably, some will join from their phone, not sign in, etc. resulting in
      spending time manually setting up breakout rooms.
* Create read-only run-of-show documents to share as examples


## GitHub Discussions announcements

* When outcomes page goes live, make an announcement thanking participants for making
  the workshop a success.
* When Jupyter post goes live, make another announcement.
