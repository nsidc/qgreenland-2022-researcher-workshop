# Post-workshop TODO

## Jupyter blog post

* Start a post on a collaborative platform (HackMD, Google Docs), and invite Yuvi Panda
  to edit after we've got a first draft. We can contact Yuvi on Openscapes Slack.


## Review deliverables

* What are some interesting:
    * Notebooks
    * Discussions posts (specifically FAIR/CARE)
        * Include word cloud


## Workshop website updates

Update website to add a new top-level nav link "Outcomes" and:

* Thank participants for an awesome workshop
* Highlight deliverables (see previous section)
* Link to our blog post
* Link to Hacker News post


## Misc wrapup

* Overall impressions
* Changes we'd want to make
* Tips and tricks for running workshop
    * Let people join their own breakout rooms; trying to predict what e-mail people
      will join Zoom with and pre-configuring breakout rooms turned out to be a time
      sink. Inevitably, some will join from their phone, not sign in, etc. resulting in
      spending time manually setting up breakout rooms.
* Create read-only run-of-show documents to share as examples
