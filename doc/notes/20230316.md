# Meeting notes

## Twila feedback

* Some of our challenges, like the tables of contents being too big, can be a
  jumping-off point for a discussion of the tradeoffs of our toolset choices. Our tools
  may not be able to do everything we want perfectly, but they're open-source.
* Continued learning resources:

## Trey notes

* Can/should we pull example code in "inspecting data" to notebooks?
* Can we render the demo notebook with Quarto to add it to the website and test that all
  the dependencies are present?
* For "inspecting data", add slide(s) about "Why choose one tool over another?" Choose
  the best tool for the job! They all do mostly the same things. Explore tools in other
  ecosystems, e.g. R, MatLab, etc.
