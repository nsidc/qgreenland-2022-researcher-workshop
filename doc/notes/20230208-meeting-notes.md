# Meeting notes

## Ideas

* Can be hard to focus long-term in Zoom. More interactive activities means more engaged
  learning.
* Could record slides with narration in a video, and provide time for attendees to
  watch.
    * Could provide video for breakout room activities that informs the activity.
* Encourage workshop attendees to apply their learning to a real-life dataset on their
  own time, and provide office hours to support any issues.
* Be prepared for nobody to take advantage of office hours!
* Set expectation of X% attendance in order to be paid.
* **Provide guidelines for selecting an interesting dataset.**
* Possible day 1 activity / homework: explore QGreenland and identify a dataset that
  would pair with selected dataset.
    * How can we interact with QGreenland on Day 1?
* Link to specific tutorial videos that contain "review" content.
* Could have a guest speaker to discuss FAIR/CARE.


## Feedback

* Team likes the idea of all non-presentation activities being group-based.
* Team likes the idea of individuals selecting datasets of interest and introducing
  themselves and their dataset(s), and groups selecting one to work on.
* Team likes post-workshop office hours.
