# TODO

## Software support

* How to get attendees set up with dependencies? Want to avoid supporting Operating
  Systems we're not comfortable with.
  * Use Amazon Workspaces to provision Desktop VMs?
  * Use JupyterHub to interact with compute resources? `%%shell` enables running bash
    (`gdal`/`ogr` commands) in notebook cells.
