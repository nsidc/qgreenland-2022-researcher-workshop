* "...researchers fly in, do their work in two weeks, don’t invest in
  relationships, and fly out."


# [Group 2](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/148)

* "...sometimes have to email authors for code, poorly documented, don’t
  get everything you need, rushed to finish."
* "Concern for someone stealing code, publishing first"
* "Should we be protecting our code? Need to be actively developing something"


# [Group 3](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/147)

Excellent commentary on diverse practices in different countries.

* "present a map of tsunami risks in coastal Arctic areas, and try to
  integrate it with indigenous knowledge, reach out to the communities and
  learn what they do to prevent the risks; is in contact with Greenlandic
  school teachers"
* "CMIP models are mostly consistent in terms of variable naming, which
  makes it easy for working with several different models all together"


# [Group 5](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/146)

* "It is not just about sharing the data, but enabling further analysis on
  the data."
* "For Henna's research looking into water contamination during undergrad,
  she and her colleagues were able to connect links between pollution
  source and adverse health outcomes, but the scientific findings don't
  always make it back to the level of policy to improve the source of the
  contamination"
* "Communication is also a huge part of the equation when linking scientific
  findings to the impacts happening to the general public. Communication is really
  difficult and is a different skill set than scientific production.

* "The discussion mentioned the Kennedy Strait incident where hunters were stranded
  with their dogs, emphasizing the need for ice breakers to coordinate with
  communities. We also talked about the proposed creation of a harbor in Alaska,
  which suggested using an atomic bomb and left behind radioactive waste by some
  of their preliminary work done."
* "Community Engagement and Licensing: Some communities in Alaska have established
  an interface requiring scientists to register, disclose their activities, submit
  plans, and obtain licenses."


# [Group 7](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/151)

* "As the data has related publications (included in the website), it is really helpful
  for people who need additional & detailed information about the dataset."
* "Although we haven't seen any info regarding indigenous people's involvement in the
  data creation process (no information is provided on the website regarding CARE), we
  think the data may be beneficial to them as the data is helpful to make better
  decisions or policies."
