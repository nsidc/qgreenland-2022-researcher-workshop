# Before the workshop

## In advance

* A few e-mail reminders with checklists of prerequisites
    * CryoCloud setup is critical!
* Set up the workshop Zoom meeting's settings
    * Disable chat? Or say "We're not using it"? May want to leave it open
      just-in-case.
    * Password
    * Ensure annotations are disabled
* Invite people to `#qgreenland` channel in CryoCloud Slack
* Practice breakout room usage patterns
* Create a document with pre-selected teams
* Tasha: Who do we contact for support during the workshop if we need it? Can Tasha /
  someone be available to do last-second approvals on the day?
* Make introduction posts on GH Discussions
    * Test that non-members of our org can post to Discussions
* Pre-populate the "Dataset Ideas" section of GH Discussions with multiple posts,
  each detailing one "fallback" dataset for groups that have trouble picking one.
* Clean up/remove assessment page.


## Right before

### Zoom

* Start the Zoom call
* Give "Host" / "Co-Host" permissions to Matt, Trey, Alyse, ??
* Assign someone to let people in from waiting room
* Assign a greeter (Alyse likes this job!)
    * Immediately ask if CryoCloud is set up. If they haven't done it, move them to a
      breakout room to fill out the forms.
    * Mention recording -- we won't use footage publicly without editing out
      participants.
* _TODO: What materials do participants need right away? We want to share this in
  Slack/Zoom as people are joining. Matt & Trey think about this_
    * Slack setup: Tell people that haven't done setup to do it during the first break.
* Alyse will start recording
