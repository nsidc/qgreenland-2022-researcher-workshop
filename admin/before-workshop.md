## Zoom

* Start the Zoom call
* Give "Host" / "Co-Host" permissions to Matt, Trey, Alyse, ??
* Assign someone to let people in from waiting room
* Assign a greeter (Alyse likes this job!)
    * Immediately ask if CryoCloud is set up. If they haven't done it, move them to a
      breakout room to fill out the forms.
    * Mention recording -- we won't use footage publicly without editing out
      participants.
* _TODO: What materials do participants need right away? We want to share this in
  Slack/Zoom as people are joining. Matt & Trey think about this_
    * Slack setup: Tell people that haven't done setup to do it during the first break.
* Alyse will start recording
