Remember: Going in and out of breakout rooms has a ~5 minute cost.

- [ ] Does the current exercise have multiple steps? Do we need to do time-checks, e.g.
      broadcast "You should be done with step 1 by now, please move on to step 2"?


## Closing

- [ ] Give a 5-minute warning before closing the breakout rooms: There's a "Broadcast a
      message" button we can use in the breakout room submenu.
- [ ] Close the breakout rooms: When we do this, everyone gets a 60 second countdown.
