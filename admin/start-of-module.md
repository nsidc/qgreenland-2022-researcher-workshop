- [ ] Link to module in Slack with `@channel` mention to notify everyone.


## Slides

- [ ] Use a browser other than Firefox for the prettiest slides experience (this is
      *not* critical)
- [ ] Ensure browser zoom is set to 100%


## Prep for breakout rooms

- [ ] Set up the breakout rooms (Alyse is doing the first slide deck, so Matt / Trey /
      intern / student will do this on module 1, Alyse will do that for other modules).
- [ ] The same person who set up the breakout rooms will trigger sending them into the
      room later
    * Click "Open breakout rooms" and everyone will get sent (after clicking "confirm")
