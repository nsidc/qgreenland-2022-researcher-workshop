Some exercises are individual, others are group. Stuff specific to breakout rooms is in
the "Breakout rooms" section of this doc :)


## Exercises

### Intro to JupyterLab

- [ ] The exploration part of this exercise may take longer than expected. Provide a
      reminder after 15 minutes that it's time to start working on the notebook portion
      of the exercise.


## Breakout rooms

::: {.callout-warning}
Remember: Going in and out of breakout rooms has a ~5 minute cost.
:::

- [ ] Does the current exercise have multiple steps? Do we need to do time-checks, e.g.
      broadcast "You should be done with step 1 by now, please move on to step 2"?


### Closing

- [ ] Give a 5-minute warning before closing the breakout rooms: There's a "Broadcast a
      message" button we can use in the breakout room submenu.
- [ ] Close the breakout rooms: When we do this, everyone gets a 60 second countdown.
