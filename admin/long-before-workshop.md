* A few e-mail reminders with checklists of prerequisites
    * CryoCloud setup is critical!
* Set up the workshop Zoom meeting's settings
    * Disable chat? Or say "We're not using it"? May want to leave it open
      just-in-case.
    * Password
    * Ensure annotations are turned off
    * Ensure captions are enabled and tested
* Invite people to `#qgreenland` channel in CryoCloud Slack
* Practice breakout room usage patterns
* Create a document with pre-selected teams
* Tasha: Who do we contact for support during the workshop if we need it? Can Tasha /
  someone be available to do last-second approvals on the day?
* Make introduction posts on GH Discussions
    * Test that non-members of our org can post to Discussions
* Pre-populate the "Dataset Ideas" section of GH Discussions with multiple posts,
  each detailing one "fallback" dataset for groups that have trouble picking one.
* Clean up/remove assessment page.
