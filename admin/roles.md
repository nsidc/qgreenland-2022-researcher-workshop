## Slides

* Presenter
    * Matt & Trey present technical slides, probably alternating
    * Alyse can present non-technical slides (daily overview, communication, code of
      conduct)
* Whoever is not presenting (multiple people) will watch chat, admit from waiting room,
  vibe-check (look for people who are struggling)
* At the end of each slide deck, presenter will review the exercises by screen sharing
  the webpage


## Exercises

* Preset the breakout rooms (Alyse is doing the first slide deck, so Matt / Trey will
  do this, Alyse will do that for other slide decks)
    * Pre-assign them and manually send them into the room
* Click "Open breakout rooms" and everyone will get sent (after clicking "confirm")
* Give a 5-minute warning before closing the breakout rooms: There's a "Broadcast a
  message" button we can use in the breakout room submenu.
* Close the breakout rooms: When we do this, everyone gets a 60 second countdown. Can we
  change this in the meeting settings? _Yes, but we're going to stick with the default
  60 seconds._
