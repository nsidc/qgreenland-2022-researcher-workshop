## Overview

QGreenland curates Greenland-focused data ready for research and analysis. The
QGreenland data package represents only a small portion of available data, much of which
requires specialized skills to handle. The goal of this workshop is to equip researchers
with the necessary skills to evaluate data quality, standards-compliance, and develop
best practices for open-science geospatial workflows which enable use with QGreenland.

Participants will work as small teams (~4 people) to engage in discussion on
open-science practices and tools like JupyterLab and GitHub, work through several
data-based exercises focused on gaining first-hand experience making data ready for
analysis, and develop practices for collaboration. Groups will be organized with diverse
skillsets, and you should expect to both teach and learn from your group.

This workshop is aimed primarily at graduate level or higher researchers interested in
answering questions about Greenland using geospatial data. Basic knowledge of QGIS and
experience using QGreenland are assumed.


### Benefits of participation

* $250 stipend for successful completion of workshop
* Gain skills to make data QGreenland-friendly and standards compliant
* A portfolio of Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub demonstrating skills developed during the workshop
* Extend your network of researchers answering questions about Greenland


### Is this workshop for me?

* Do you want to learn more about geospatial data and metadata standards and practices?
* Do you want to be able to produce new datasets and modify existing datasets to
  maximize usability in GIS tools (for example, with QGreenland)?

If you answer to these questions is yes, than this workshop is for YOU!
