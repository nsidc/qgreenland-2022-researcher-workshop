#### Develop standards-based geospatial data practices

_May 23-25, 2023_

Apply [here](https://forms.gle/HkgtxhHSBTuqiRLf7) between March 15 - April 3, 2023.


## Overview

QGreenland curates Greenland-focused data ready for research and analysis. The
QGreenland data package represents only a small portion of available data, much of which
requires specialized skills to handle. The goal of this workshop is to equip researchers
with the necessary skills to evaluate data quality, standards-compliance, and develop
best practices for open-science geospatial workflows which enable use with QGreenland.

Participants will work in small groups to engage in discussion on open-science practices
and tools like JupyterLab and GitHub, work through several data-based exercises focused
on gaining first-hand experience making data ready for analysis, and develop practices
for collaboration.

This workshop is aimed primarily at graduate level or higher researchers interested in
answering questions about Greenland using geospatial data. Basic knowledge of QGIS and
experience using QGreenland are assumed.


### Benefits of Participation

* $250 stipend for successful completion of workshop
* Gain skills to make data QGreenland-friendly and standards compliant
* A portfolio of Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub demonstrating skills developed during the workshop
* Extend your network of researchers answering questions about Greenland


### Is this workshop for me?

* Do you want to learn more about data and metadata standards and practices?
* Do you want to be able to produce new datasets and modify existing datasets to maximize usability?

If you answer to these questions is yes, than this workshop is for YOU!
