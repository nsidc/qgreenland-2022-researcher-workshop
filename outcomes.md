## âœ¨ What our participants created

### Group discussions on FAIR & CARE data principles

![Word cloud produced from participant's insights](/_media/fair-care-wordcloud.png)

Our participants engaged in small group discussions on
[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and
[CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care) data principles and recorded their insights on
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/categories/fair-care).

Highlights include:

> ...researchers fly in, do their work in two weeks, donâ€™t invest in
> relationships, and fly out. - [Group
> 1](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/150)

> Concern for someone stealing code, publishing first - [Group
> 2](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/148)

> It is not just about sharing the data, but enabling further analysis on the
> data. - [Group
> 5](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/146)

> Some communities in Alaska have established an interface requiring scientists
> to register, disclose their activities, submit plans, and obtain licenses. -

### Explored geospatial data using Jupyter Notebooks

Participants worked together to explore, transform, and visualize geospatial
data from a variety of sources using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

For example:

* [Group 1](https://github.com/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/group-one)
  produced a
  [Notebook](https://github.com/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/group-one/blob/main/Python_ds_analysis.ipynb)
  utilizing `Python` to reproject, plot, and resample [ETOPO1 bedrock elevation
  data for Greenland](/content/example-data/etopo1_bedrock_elevation) as part of
  the [Make the data work together
  exercise](/content/exercises/data-compatibility.md).

* [Group 3](https://github.com/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/group-three)
  explored the use of tools like `gdalinfo`, `ncdump`, and `Python` to inspect
  [CMIP5](https://psl.noaa.gov/ipcc/ocn/ccwp.html) data in their
  [Notebook](https://github.com/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/group-three/blob/main/exercise_inspect_data.ipynb)
  created for the [Data inspection with JupyterLab
  exercise](/content/exercises/data-inspection-with-jupyterlab/index.md).

All workshop outputs can be found in each group's respective GitHub
repository. See the list
