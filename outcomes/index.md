title: "Outcomes"
---

ðŸŽ‰ Our workshop concluded on May 25, 2023. Thank you to all participants for making this
workshop a success!

Over the course of the workshop, participants engaged on topics including:

* Foundational geospatial data concepts
* Open science and geospatial data standards
* Making data analysis-ready
* Literate programming
* Symbolizing data

Through exercises related to each of these topics, participants produced Jupyter
Notebooks, engaged in group discussions and posted notes on GitHub Discussions, and used
QGIS to explore, symbolize, and inspect data alongside QGreenland.

We learned a lot from our participants and we are very grateful for their engagement!


## âœ¨ What our participants created

### Group discussions on FAIR & CARE data principles

![Word cloud produced from participant's insights](/_media/fair-care-wordcloud.png)

Our participants engaged in small group discussions on
[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and
[CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care) data principles and recorded their insights on
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/categories/fair-care).

Highlights include:

> ...researchers fly in, do their work in two weeks, donâ€™t invest in
> relationships, and fly out. - [Group
> 1](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/150)

> Concern for someone stealing code, publishing first - [Group
> 2](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/148)

<!-- alex ignore just -->
> It is not just about sharing the data, but enabling further analysis on the
> data. - [Group
> 5](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/146)

> Some communities in Alaska have established an interface requiring scientists
> to register, disclose their activities, submit plans, and obtain licenses. -
> [Group
> 6](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/149)


### Explored geospatial data using Jupyter Notebooks

Participants worked together to explore, transform, and visualize geospatial
data from a variety of sources using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

For example:

* [Group 1](https://github.com/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/group-one)
  produced a
  [Notebook](https://github.com/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/group-one/blob/main/Python_ds_analysis.ipynb)
  utilizing `Python` to reproject, plot, and resample [ETOPO1 bedrock elevation
  data for Greenland](/content/example-data/etopo1_bedrock_elevation) as part of
  the [Make the data work together
  exercise](/content/exercises/data-compatibility.md).

* [Group 3](https://github.com/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/group-three)
  explored the use of tools like `gdalinfo`, `ncdump`, and `Python` to inspect
  [CMIP5](https://psl.noaa.gov/ipcc/ocn/ccwp.html) data in their
  [Notebook](https://github.com/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/group-three/blob/main/exercise_inspect_data.ipynb)
  created for the [Data inspection with JupyterLab
  exercise](/content/exercises/data-inspection-with-jupyterlab/index.md).

All workshop outputs can be found in each group's respective GitHub
repository. See the list
[here](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/repositories?q=group-&type=all&language=&sort=).


We have also created a [backup](./qgreenland-workshop-shared-public.tar.gz) of workshop
outputs that were in the `shared-public/` directory on the CryoCloud JupyterHub. We
intentionally kept only notebooks and style files, omitting data files, to keep the size
small. Data files will need to be re-downloaded or re-created.


## âŒ› Retrospective

### Jupyter Blog post

We were kindly invited to post on the [Jupyter Blog](https://blog.jupyter.org). Our post
