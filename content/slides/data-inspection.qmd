# Inspection with QGIS

* You can use QGIS to inspect both raster and vector data
* You can compare this data to other layers, e.g. basemap. 

::: {.notes}
This can be a pitfall; if the datum differs from other layers, there could be
discrepancies that are hard to detect. When doing an analysis, transform all layers to
the same datum using e.g. `gdalwarp`, `ogr2ogr`.
