# Geospatial data

![Vector vs Raster](https://pygis.io/_images/vector_vs_raster.jpg)

::: {.notes}
Two main representations of geospatial data: vector and raster.
:::


## Vector data

Choose the right feature type:

* Point
* Line
* Polygon

![Vector map (Wikimedia Commons)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Simple_vector_map.svg)


## Vector attributes

::: {.r-fit-text}
Attributes add additional data to a geospatial element

* A point representing a weather station may have a `temperature` attribute
* a line representing a river may have a `name` attribute
* A polygon representing a state may have a `population` attribute
:::

## Vector topology {.smaller}

* Spatial relationships between vector features.
* E.g,
  * "what points fall within a given polygon?"
  * "What polygons are adjacent to this one?"

::: {.notes}
_TODO: keep this slide here? Day 3? Or remove? This is more about analysis with
vector features. Another thing to think about: vector validity (e.g.,
non-self-crossing lines)?_
:::


## Raster data

* Continuous: temperature, sea ice concentration, wind speed
* Categorical: land cover, cloud type, storm category

![RGB Raster Image (Wikimedia Commons)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Rgb-raster-image.svg)

:::{.notes}
* Rasters can sometimes contain a mix of continuous and categorical data (a
  measure plus flag values, e.g., sea ice concentration with "land", "coast",
  "lake" flags).

* The symbology of raster data may be categorical while the underlying data is
  continuous (e.g., high/medium/low sea ice concentration).
:::


## Continuous raster data

## Categorical raster data

# Metadata

Data about data

::: {.notes}
Metadata is "data about data", and is how standards-compliant data files
"self-describe".

For example, this data is in "North Polar Stereographic" projection.
:::

## Geospatial metadata concepts

* Location: where does a feature occur in space/on the Earth.
* Time: when did the feature occur?
* Provenance: Where did the data come from and what kind of processing was applied?
* Measurement information
  * What units of measure is the feature recorded in?
  * "Missing/No Data" and other flags

# Coordinate Reference System (CRS) information

Includes all of the information necessary to accurately locate features on Earth.

::: {.callout-note}
**Coordinate Reference System (CRS)** == **Spatial Reference System (SRS)**
:::


## Geodetic Datums

::: {.r-fit-text}
A model representation of the Earth serving as a reference for locating features.

* Often a spherical or ellipsoidal representation.
* Horizontal and/or vertical.
* `WGS84` is a common global datum, but many others (including locally best-fitting models).
* Differences between datums can be significant (> 100 meters in some cases).
:::

Commons)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Gloabl_and_Regional_Ellipsoids.svg/256px-Gloabl_and_Regional_Ellipsoids.svg.png)


::: {.notes}
_Datum shift_ is the difference in lat/lon of a location between different
datums. E.g., a surveyed location will have different lat/lon values under
different datums, sometimes resulting in significant differences (> 100 meters in some
cases).

_TODO: can we find a better image that shows differences between Earth, ellipsoid, and geoid?_
:::


## Geographic Coordinate System (GCS)

Coordinate system that represents locations on the Earth in spherical
coordinates of latitudes and longitudes.

![Diagram of the latitude Ï• and longitude Î» angle measurements for a spherical
model of the Earth (Wikimedia
Commons)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Latitude_and_longitude_graticule_on_a_sphere.svg/1024px-Latitude_and_longitude_graticule_on_a_sphere.svg.png)

::: {.notes}
By default in programs like QGIS, data referenced to a Geographic Coordinate
System (unprojected) are shown in an 'equirectangular' projection in which
latitudes are mapped to the Y axis and longitudes are mapped to the X axis of a
planar coordinate system.
:::


## Projected Coordinate System (PCS)

::: {.r-fit-text}
Coordinate system that represents locations on the Earth in planar coordinates (X, Y).

* Projection is the transformation of spherical (lat/lon) coordinates to a planar surface.
* Benefits include visualization on flat surfaces (e.g., maps) and simplified distance calculations.
* Projection results in one or more distortions: shape, area, distance, direction

::: {.notes}
A projection is an algorithm (e.g., stereographic) and its parameters (e.g,
lat/lon of origin, units, etc).

[A PCS is a GCS with a map
projection](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/mapping/properties/coordinate-systems-and-projections.htm).

There are MANY map projections. Each has advantages and disadvantages depending
on use-case and the part of the world being mapped.

* _TODO: how do size images so that they take up the remaining space?_

### [European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) Geodetic Parameter Dataset codes](https://epsg.org/home.html)
```{.text code-line-numbers="false"}
EPSG:3413
```
::: {.notes}
Extremely concise, EPSG maintains a registry of codes that map to CRS definitions in a standard database used by tools like `gdal`.

Note there are other standard representations as well, e.g., Geography Markup Language (GML). The three listed here (WKT, Proj, EPSG codes) are some of the most common.
:::


## Metadata standards

When a dataset follows of one or more common standards, GIS practitioners and
tools can accurately parse information about CRS, date/time, etc.

See the [Continued
learning](/content/continued-learning.html#data-and-metadata-standards) page for
examples of common standards.

:::{.notes}
Standards for metadata are often context-dependent. Some standards are developed
for particular data formats, others are focused on certain scientific domains
(e.g, Ecological Markup Language, EML).
