## Breakout: Select and analyze a dataset

::: {.r-fit-text}
* Select a dataset that your group will work on.
  * _TODO: Consider guidelines for selecting an interesting dataset._
* Try to open your data in QGIS. Is that possible?
* Identify key attributes of the data/metadata ("Unknown" is an expected answer)
    * Data type (raster, vector, etc.)
    * File type (XLSX, CSV, Shapefile, NetCDF, etc)
    * Projection
    * Extent (e.g. corner coordinates / edge values)
* Choose a note-taker and record this information in whatever way you feel
  comfortable. We will come back to these notes later!
    * NOTE: Do not take notes in Zoom chat; they will disappear.
