# Discussion: Review of Open Science (and data) principles

## Value of version control and doing work "in the open"

* GitHub Discussions
* _TODO: Example Open Source research repositories?_

## Important data principles: [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

<!-- TODO: more links! -->
::: {.incremental .r-fit-text}
* **<u>F</u>**indable
    * "Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans **and computers**."
* **<u>A</u>**ccessible
    * Metadata and data should be easy to acquire for both humans **and computers**.
* **<u>I</u>**nteroperable
    * Data should be easy to integrate with other data and software.
      <!-- Should we mention the utility of "self-describing" data formats here? -->
* **<u>R</u>**eusable
    * [Well-described](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-metadata-richly-described-plurality-accurate-relevant-attributes/),

## Important data principles: [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care)

::: {.incremental .r-fit-text}
* **<u>C</u>**ollective Benefit
    * Data and the systems around them should strive to benefit Indigenous
      communities.
* **<u>A</u>**uthority to Control
    * Indigenous Peoples should have the right to govern their data and
      representations of their communities in data. Data collection efforts
      should include the participation of Indigenous communities.
* **<u>R</u>**esponsibility
    * Users of Indigenous data have the responsibility to share data in a way
      that supports Indigenous Peoples and culture.
* **<u>E</u>**thics
    * The rights and wellbeing of Indigenous Peoples should be the priority
      through all aspects of the data life-cycle.

* [STREAM](https://www.itu.int/en/journal/002/Documents/ITU2018-12.pdf)?
  * _TODO: is this actually relevant? It's talking about data practices in the
    context of markets / commodification of data._
* [International Open Data Charter](https://opendatacharter.net/)
* _TODO: FAIR/CARE data checker? Arctic Data Center maybe has something like this. Ask?_
