* A polygon representing a state may have a `population` attribute


## Raster data

* Continuous
* Categorical

* Interpolation
    * Use "nearest neighbor" with categorical data, or there will be "smudging" between
      categories.
* _TODO: What else?_
* _TODO: consider moving this discussion to day 3? This is an operation that is more
  aligned with the goal of preparing data for a specific use case._


## Other data types

We won't focus on these:

* Point cloud
* _TODO: What else?_
