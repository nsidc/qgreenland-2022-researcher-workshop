## What tool should I use?

The best one for the job.

Explore the alternatives available in the ecosystem you want to work!

::: {.notes}
You may recognize this slide from the "data inspection" deck.

Tool selection is context-dependent.

Command-line tools are especially useful for getting a quick answer.

Language-specific tools are good for automations or research code. These
examples use Python because that's what we're most familiar with, but explore
your preferred ecosystem and you'll find equivalents.

## TODO

<!-- TODO:
* Discuss geospatial data transformations
    * Concepts
        * Reprojection
            * _TODO: consider discussion about characteristics of common
              projections and why you might want to use one over another._
        * Resampling
        * Subsetting
        * Conversion (raster <-> vector)
        * _TODO: Consider discussion about information loss from common
          transformations (reprojection, resampling, datatype conversion
          (raster<->vector))_
    * Tools / Techniques
        * QGIS Processing Toolbox (brief mention, participants should be
          familiar with this from the [beginner tutorial
          series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znKeiV3-Amo&amp;index=5)).
        * gdalwarp, ogr2ogr, ...
        * Python (rasterio, shapely, Xarray, pyresample, PyQGIS, ...)
        * _TODO: create notebook examples for various tools_
    * Pitfalls
        * Some metadata in the source data may be carried over to the output,
          resulting in outdated metadata. For example, we have that issue with
          the bedmachine data produced for QGreenland. We can `gdalwarp` a
          bedmachine dataset to WGS84 and observe that the `mapping#` namespace
          continues to specify "polar stereographic" projection. On the plus side,
          citation and other metadata which we want to keep was also pulled over. This
          means you may need to do some manual metadata management when you apply
          transformations.
