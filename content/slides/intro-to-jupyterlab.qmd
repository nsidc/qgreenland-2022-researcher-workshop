## JupyterHub

Your personal JupyterLab in the cloud

* CryoCloud
    * JupyterHub: <https://hub.cryointhecloud.com>
    * Website: <https://book.cryointhecloud.com>

* Log in to CryoCloud JupyterHub with your GitHub username
    * Important: select a _small_ server!
    * Your JupyterLab is dedicated, _not_ shared!

::: {.notes}
JupyterHub is a system for creating many JupyterLabs, e.g. for classrooms

JupyterLab is not shared!

* Other attendees can't see your files (except those in `shared/` dir)
* No scheduler like on a supercomputer
    * Your computations won't interfere with anyone else's

# What can I do in my JupyterLab?

ðŸ’» Almost anything you can do on your personal computer!

ðŸ‘ª JupyterLab is a human-friendly interface to computation resources.


## File browser

* Drag & drop from your desktop
* Open many types of files and get a useful display
    * CSV will display as table
    * GeoJSON will display on a map
    * Images will open with an image viewer


## Applications

* Terminal
    * `conda install <package>` / `mamba install <package>`
* Desktop / QGIS
    * Has access to the files in your JupyterLab
* Jupyter Notebooks

Conda and Mamba are already installed, and a `notebook` environment is pre-created. Use
`conda`/`mamba` commands to install Python dependencies into the `notebook` environment.

## Jupyter Notebooks

* A tool for [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
    * Showing your work
    * Tracking provenance
    * Telling a story
* See also:

    * JupyterBook
    * _TODO: Others?_


## Jupyter Notebook example

* Walk through running an example notebook and viewing its output in QGIS?
    * _TODO: Finalize `demo.ipynb`. Include something simple for users to try changing._
