## JupyterHub

Your personal JupyterLab in the cloud

* CryoCloud
    * JupyterHub: <https://hub.cryointhecloud.com>
    * Website: <https://book.cryointhecloud.com>

* Log in to CryoCloud JupyterHub with your GitHub username
    * Important: select a _small_ server!
    * Your JupyterLab is dedicated, _not_ shared!

::: {.notes}
JupyterHub is a system for creating many JupyterLabs, e.g. for classrooms

JupyterLab is not shared!

* Other attendees can't see your files (except those in `shared/` dir)
* No scheduler like on a supercomputer
    * Your computations won't interfere with anyone else's
:::


# What can I do in my JupyterLab?

ðŸ’» Almost anything you can do on your personal computer!

ðŸ‘ª JupyterLab is a human-friendly interface to computation resources.

When demoing the notebook, ensure that we narrate double-clicking markdown cells
