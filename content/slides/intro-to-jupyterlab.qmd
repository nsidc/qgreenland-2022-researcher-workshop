## JupyterHub

Your personal JupyterLab in the cloud

* CryoCloud
    * JupyterHub: <https://hub.cryointhecloud.com>
    * Website: <https://book.cryointhecloud.com>

* Log in to CryoCloud JupyterHub with your GitHub username
    * Important: select a _small_ server!
    * Your JupyterLab is dedicated, _not_ shared!

::: {.notes}
JupyterHub is a system for creating many JupyterLabs, e.g. for classrooms

JupyterLab is not shared!

* Other attendees can't see your files (except those in `shared/` dir)
* No scheduler like on a supercomputer
    * Your computations won't interfere with anyone else's
:::


# What can I do in my JupyterLab?

ðŸ’» Almost anything you can do on your personal computer!

ðŸ‘ª JupyterLab is a human-friendly interface to computation resources.


## File browser

* Drag & drop from your desktop
* Open many types of files and get a useful display
    * CSV will display as table
    * GeoJSON will display on a map
    * Images will open with an image viewer

* _TODO: Image of file browser on the side of this slide_


## Terminal

* `conda install <package>`
* `mamba install <package>`
* Common GDAL/OGR utilities: `gdalinfo`, `ogrinfo`, etc.

::: {.notes}
Conda and Mamba are already installed, and a `notebook` environment is pre-created. Use
`conda`/`mamba` commands to install Python dependencies into the `notebook` environment.
:::


## Desktop (with QGIS) {.smaller}

* Has access to the files in your JupyterLab
* On first launch, select "Use default config"

    ![Use default config](/_media/xfce_first_launch.png)

* The "Home" icon on the desktop shows the same files as File Browser.
* Can open QGreenland!

::: {.callout-warning}
Do not use "Logout" within your desktop
:::

::: {.notes}
Opening QGreenland should take ~2 minutes.

Do not use the logout function within the desktop, as this may make it difficult to get
back into your desktop.
:::


## Jupyter Notebooks

* A tool for [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
    * Showing your work
    * Tracking provenance
    * Telling a story
* See also:
    * Quarto
    * JupyterBook
    * _TODO: Others?_


## Jupyter Notebook example

* Walk through running an example notebook and viewing its output in QGIS?
    * _TODO: Finalize `demo.ipynb`. Include something simple for users to try changing._


# Important: Please log out when done!

_At the end of each day, click `File > Log Out`_

::: {.notes}
Log out at the end of each day to save on cloud costs.

Any files you've created will remain next time you log in.
