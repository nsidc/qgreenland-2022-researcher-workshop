# Intro to GitHub

* Provide a "taste" of the utility of Git and GitHub
* Intermediate/advanced topics out of scope
    * See [continued learning](/content/continued-learning.html#gitgithub) page
    * Attend office hours!

::: {.notes}
We love Git and are excited to teach about it, but we don't have room in this workshop
to fit that and still meet our other goals. We welcome anyone who wants to learn more to
attend office hours on day 4. We also provide resources for continued independent
learning.

## Working "in the open"

## Working "in the open"

* Open Science principles can apply to work in progress, too!
    * Easier if you are open from the beginning.
* Git/Hub is not just for coders!
    * Documentation in GitHub as an Open Science methodology

::: {.notes}
Open Science principles can apply to all of the work that you are doing. Now that we
have some knowledge about the data that we want to keep track of and share with others,
let's utilize GitHub as the mechanism to translate that knowledge to documentation.

_TODO: Examples of "Git is not just for coders"._
_TODO: Brief differentiation between Git and GitHub._

## Demo: Creating a GitHub repository

* Create a GitHub repository
* Enable GitHub Discussions
* Create a README file

::: {.notes}
Demonstrate creating a git repository in the GitHub interface with a `README.md` file
with the type of knowledge we want groups to record about their dataset. Use an existing
QGreenland data layer as an example.
