## Working "in the open"

* Open Science principles can apply to work in progress, too!
* Open Science is easier if you are open from the beginning.
* Git is not just for coders!
    * Documentation in GitHub as an Open Science methodology

::: {.notes}
Open Science principles can apply to all of the work that you are doing. Now that we
have some knowledge about the data that we want to keep track of and share with others,
let's utilize GitHub as the mechanism to translate that knowledge to documentation.

_TODO: Examples of "Git is not just for coders"._
_TODO: Brief differentiation between Git and GitHub._

## Demo: Creating a GitHub repository

* Create a GitHub repository
* Enable GitHub Discussions
* Create a README file

::: {.notes}
Demonstrate creating a git repository in the GitHub interface with a `README.md` file
with the type of knowledge we want groups to record about their dataset. Use an existing
QGreenland data layer as an example.
