## Open Science is here this year, get used to it!

2023 is the [Federal Year of Open
    Science](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/01/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-advance-open-and-equitable-research/)

## Important data principles: [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

<!-- TODO: more links! -->
<!-- alex disable easy -->
::: {.incremental .r-fit-text}
* **<u>F</u>**indable
    * "Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans **and computers**."
* **<u>A</u>**ccessible
    * Metadata and data should be easy to acquire for both humans **and computers**.
* **<u>I</u>**nteroperable
    * Data should be easy to integrate with other data and software.
      <!-- Should we mention the utility of "self-describing" data formats here? -->
* **<u>R</u>**eusable
    * [Well-described](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-metadata-richly-described-plurality-accurate-relevant-attributes/),

## FAIR: DataOne

Datasets registered with DataOne include a _Metadata Assessment Report_ that
rates the dataset on FAIR compliance.

::: {.notes}
The Arctic Data Center, as a participating DataOne repository, also has FAIR
data assessments. Additionally, the ADC has it's own assessment suite.

## Important data principles: [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care)

::: {.incremental .r-fit-text}
* **<u>C</u>**ollective Benefit
    * Data and the systems around them should strive to benefit Indigenous
      communities.
* **<u>A</u>**uthority to Control
    * Indigenous Peoples should have the right to govern their data and
      representations of their communities in data. Data collection efforts
      should include the participation of Indigenous communities.
* **<u>R</u>**esponsibility
    * Users of Indigenous data have the responsibility to share data in a way
      that supports Indigenous Peoples and culture.
* **<u>E</u>**thics
    * The rights and wellbeing of Indigenous Peoples should be the priority
      through all aspects of the data life-cycle.

## Communication is key

If you are actively engaged in research in the Arctic, make yourself familiar
with recommended communication channels and programs for interfacing with local
communities.

::: {.r-fit-text}
* [Issaffik Arctic Gateway](https://isaaffik.org/): user driven web platform
  supporting Arctic research and collaboration.
* [Arctic Hub](https://arctichub.gl/): a space where researchers can connect,
  institutions can collaborate, and citizens can engage in Greenlandic research.
* [Navigating the New Arctic Community Office](https://nna-co.org/): building
  awareness, partnerships, opportunities, and resources for collaboration and
  equitable knowledge generation within, between, and beyond the research
  projects funded by the [NSF] [NNA
  Initiative](https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/big_ideas/arctic.jsp).

::: {.notes}
Open sci is not only putting software/data/etc out there, it is about
communicating and making connections with others, including local communities.

By engaging with existing networks/programs, the research community can benefit
through discovery of new opportunities for collaborations.
