# Data

::: {.notes}
Data is actual measurements.

For example, at location (X, Y), the albedo is 39%.

## Vector data

Choose the right feature type:

* Point
* Line
* Polygon

## Vector attributes

Attributes add additional data to a geospatial element

* A point representing a weather station may have a `temperature` attribute
* A polygon representing a state may have a `population` attribute


## Raster data

* Continuous
* Categorical


## Continuous raster data

## Categorical raster data

![US Land Cover Classification](https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/NLCD_2016_Landcover.jpg)


## Raster data considerations

* Interpolation
    * Use "nearest neighbor" with categorical data, or there will be "smudging" between
      categories.
* Reprojection
    * Lossy
    * Reproject only once, if you have to.
* _TODO: What else?_
* _TODO: consider moving this discussion to day 3? This is an operation that is more
  aligned with the goal of preparing data for a specific use case._


## Other data types

We won't focus on these:

* Point cloud
* _TODO: What else?_


# Metadata

Data about data

::: {.notes}
Metadata is "data about data", and is how standards-compliant data files
"self-describe".

For example, this data is in "North Polar Stereographic" projection.
:::

## Geospatial metadata concepts

* Location: where did the observed phenomena occur in space/on the Earth.
* Time: when did the observed phenomena occur?
* Provenance: Where did the data come from and what kind of processing was applied?
* Measurement information
  * What units of measure is the phenomena recorded in?
  * "Missing/No Data" and other flags

## Coordinate Reference System (CRS) information{.smaller}

* **Coordinate Reference System (CRS)** == **Spatial Reference System (SRS)**.

* **Geodetic Datum**: A model representation of the Earth serving as a reference for locating features.
    * Often a spherical or ellipsoidal representation.
    * Horizontal and/or vertical.
    * `WGS84` is a common global datum, but many others (including locally best-fitting models).
    * Differences between datums can be significant (> 100m in some cases).

* **Geographic Coordinate System (GCS)**: Coordinate system that represents locations on the Earth in spherical coordinates of latitudes and longitudes.

* **Projected Coordinate System (PCS)**: Coordinate system that represents locations on the Earth in planar coordinates (X, Y).
    * Projection is the transformation of spherical (lat/lon) coordinates to a planar surface.
    * Benefits include visualization on flat surfaces (e.g., maps) and simplfied distance calculations.
    * Projection results in one or more distortions: shape, area, distance, direction


::: {.notes}
* A coordinate reference system (CRS) / spatial reference system (SRS) includes the information necessary for accurately locating geospatial data on the Earth.

* Horizontal _and_ vertical datums. _TODO: include information about this in slide directy?_

* _Datum shift_ is the difference in lat/lon of a location between different datums. E.g., a surveyed location will have different lat/lon values under different datums, sometimes resulting in significant differences (> 100m in some cases).

* Datums like WGS84 have multiple 'realizations' (re-estimates of the locations of monumented points). These realizations are often prompted by technological advancements in surveying (e.g., laser ranging, GPS). Differences between raelizations of WGS84 can be on the scale of a few meters.

* By default in programs like QGIS, data referenced to a Geographic Coordinate System (unprojected) are shown in an 'equirectangular' projection in which latitudes are mapped to the Y axis and longitudes are mapped to the X axis of a planar coordinate sysatem.

_TODO: Find a diagram!_
_TODO: include reference to geotransforms somewhere? Maybe in slides about
representing geospatial metadata (EPSG codes, WKT, proj parameters, etc)_

## Representing geospatial metadata

* [Well Known Text (WKT)](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/18-010r7/18-010r7.html)
* [Proj parameters](https://proj.org/usage/projections.html)
* [European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) Geodetic Parameter Dataset](https://epsg.org/home.html)


## Metadata standards

* [NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions](https://cfconventions.org/)
* [Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata](https://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/metadata/base-metadata/v2_0698.pdf)
  * CF conventions use the FGDC standards as a guide.
* [Cooperative Ocean/Atmosphere Research Data Service (COARDS) NetCDF Conventions](https://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/documentation/coards-netcdf-conventions)
  * CF "[conventions generalize and extend the COARDS conventions](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/build/ch01s04.html)"
* [ISO 19111:2019, Geographic information â€” Referencing by coordinates](https://www.iso.org/standard/74039.html)
* [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards](https://www.ogc.org/standards/)
* _TODO: More!_

::: {.notes}
When a dataset follows a combination of one or more common standards, GIS practitioners and tools can accurately parse information about CRS, date/time, etc.
