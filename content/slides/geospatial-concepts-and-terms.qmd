# Data

::: {.notes}
Data is actual measurements.

For example, at location (X, Y), the albedo is 39%.
:::


## Vector data

Choose the right feature type:

* Point
* Line
* Polygon

![Simple vector map (Wikimedia Commons)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Simple_vector_map.svg)


## Vector attributes

::: {.r-fit-text}
Attributes add additional data to a geospatial element

* A point representing a weather station may have a `temperature` attribute
* a line representing a river may have a `name` attribute
* A polygon representing a state may have a `population` attribute
:::

QGreenland](/_media/qgreenland_GEM-research-stations_attribute_table.png)


## Raster data

* Continuous
* Categorical


## Continuous raster data

![Continuous data image](/_media/qgreenland_seaice_concentration_feb2015.png)


## Categorical raster data

## Raster data considerations

* Interpolation
    * Use "nearest neighbor" with categorical data, or there will be "smudging" between
      categories.
* Reprojection
    * Lossy
    * Reproject only once, if you have to.
* _TODO: What else?_
* _TODO: consider moving this discussion to day 3? This is an operation that is more
  aligned with the goal of preparing data for a specific use case._


## Other data types

We won't focus on these:

* Point cloud
* Triangular Irregular Networks (TINs)
* _TODO: What else?_

::: {.notes}
_TODO: is it even worth discussing these as 'other' data types? Point clouds are
just a special case of vector data, as are TINs._
:::


# Metadata

Data about data

::: {.notes}
Metadata is "data about data", and is how standards-compliant data files
"self-describe".

For example, this data is in "North Polar Stereographic" projection.
:::

## Geospatial metadata concepts

* Location: where does a feature occur in space/on the Earth.
* Time: when did the feature occur?
* Provenance: Where did the data come from and what kind of processing was applied?
* Measurement information
  * What units of measure is feature recorded in?
  * "Missing/No Data" and other flags

## Coordinate Reference System (CRS) information

Includes all of the information necessary to accurately locate features on Earth.

::: {.callout-note}
**Coordinate Reference System (CRS)** == **Spatial Reference System (SRS)**
:::

::: {.notes}
A coordinate reference system (CRS) / spatial reference system (SRS) includes
the information necessary for accurately locating geospatial data on the Earth.
:::

## CRS: Geodetic Datums

::: {.r-fit-text}
A model representation of the Earth serving as a reference for locating features.

* Often a spherical or ellipsoidal representation.
* Horizontal and/or vertical.
* `WGS84` is a common global datum, but many others (including locally best-fitting models).
* Differences between datums can be significant (> 100 meters in some cases).
:::

![Global and regional ellipsoids (Wikimedia
Commons)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Gloabl_and_Regional_Ellipsoids.svg/256px-Gloabl_and_Regional_Ellipsoids.svg.png)


::: {.notes}
_Datum shift_ is the difference in lat/lon of a location between different
datums. E.g., a surveyed location will have different lat/lon values under
different datums, sometimes resulting in significant differences (> 100 meters in some
cases).

_TODO: can we find a better image that shows differences between Earth, ellipsoid, and geoid?_
:::

## CRS: Geographic Coordinate System (GCS)

Coordinate system that represents locations on the Earth in spherical
coordinates of latitudes and longitudes.

![Diagram of the latitude ϕ and longitude λ angle measurements for a spherical
model of the Earth (Wikimedia
Commons)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Latitude_and_longitude_graticule_on_a_sphere.svg/1024px-Latitude_and_longitude_graticule_on_a_sphere.svg.png)

::: {.notes}
By default in programs like QGIS, data referenced to a Geographic Coordinate
System (unprojected) are shown in an 'equirectangular' projection in which
latitudes are mapped to the Y axis and longitudes are mapped to the X axis of a
planar coordinate system.
:::

## CRS: Projected Coordinate System (PCS)

::: {.r-fit-text}
Coordinate system that represents locations on the Earth in planar coordinates (X, Y).

* Projection is the transformation of spherical (lat/lon) coordinates to a planar surface.
* Benefits include visualization on flat surfaces (e.g., maps) and simplified distance calculations.
* Projection results in one or more distortions: shape, area, distance, direction

:::


::: {.notes}
A projection is an algorithm (e.g., stereographic) and its parameters (e.g,
lat/lon of origin, units, etc).

[A PCS is a GCS with a map
projection](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/mapping/properties/coordinate-systems-and-projections.htm).

There are MANY map projections. Each has advantages and disadvantages depending
on use-case and the part of the world being mapped.

_TODO: how do size images so that they take up the remaining space?_

::: {.notes}
Extremely concise, EPSG maintains a registry of codes that map to CRS definitions in a standard database used by tools like `gdal`.

Note there are other standard representations as well, e.g., Geography Markup Language (GML). The three listed here (WKT, Proj, EPSG codes) are some of the most common.

* [Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata](https://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/metadata/base-metadata/v2_0698.pdf)
  * CF conventions use the FGDC standards as a guide.

When a dataset follows a combination of one or more common standards, GIS practitioners and tools can accurately parse information about CRS, date/time, etc.
