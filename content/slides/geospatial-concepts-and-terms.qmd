# Data

::: {.notes}
Data is actual measurements.

For example, at location (X, Y), the albedo is 39%.
:::


## Vector data

* Point
* Line
* Polygon

## Vector attributes

Attributes add additional data to a geospatial element

* A point representing a weather station may have a `temperature` attribute
* A polygon representing a state may have a `population` attribute


## Raster data

* Continuous
* Categorical

## Categorical raster data

## Raster data considerations

* Interpolation
    * Use "nearest neighbor" with categorical data, or there will be "smudging" between
      categories.
* _TODO: What else?_
* _TODO: consider moving this discussion to day 3? This is an operation that is more
  aligned with the goal of preparing data for a specific use case._


## Other data types

We won't focus on these:

* Point cloud
* _TODO: What else?_


# Metadata

Data about data

::: {.notes}
Metadata is "data about data", and is how standards-compliant data files
"self-describe".

For example, this data is in "North Polar Stereographic" projection.
:::


## Coordinate Reference System (CRS) information{.smaller}

* **Geodetic Datum**: A representation of an ellipsoid that best matches an area of interest on the Earth.
    * `WGS84` is a common global datum.
    
* **Geographic Coordinate System (GCS)**: Coordinate system that represents locations on the Earth in spherical coordinates of latitudes and longitudes.

* **Projection**: A 2D representation of the 3D (curved) surface of the Earth.
    * Benefits include visualization on flat surfaces (e.g., maps) and simplfied distance calculations.
    * Projection results in one or more distortions: shape, area, distance, direction

::: {.callout-note}
Even latitude/longitude coordinates need metadata (datum), particularly when the
location data is of a high precision.
:::


::: {.notes}
* A coordinate reference system (CRS) / spatial reference system (SRS) includes the information necessary for accurately locating geospatial data on the Earth.

* Horizontal _and_ vertical datums. _TODO: include information about this in slide directy?_

* _Datum shift_ is the difference in lat/lon of a location between different datums. E.g., a surveyed location will have different lat/lon values under different datums, sometimes resulting in significant differences (> 100m in some cases).

* Datums like WGS84 have multiple 'realizations' (re-estimates of the locations of monumented points). These realizations are often prompted by technological advancements in surveying (e.g., laser ranging, GPS). Differences between raelizations of WGS84 can be on the scale of a few meters.

_TODO: Find a diagram!_

## Geospatial metadata concepts

* Provenance
* Temporality (date & time related to the phenomena being measured/represented)
* "Missing/No Data" and other flags
* ...


## _TODO: More!_

_TODO_


## Metadata standards

* [NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions](https://cfconventions.org/)
* [Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata](https://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/metadata/base-metadata/v2_0698.pdf)
  * CF conventions use the FGDC standards as a guide.
* [Cooperative Ocean/Atmosphere Research Data Service (COARDS) NetCDF Conventions](https://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/documentation/coards-netcdf-conventions)
  * CF "[conventions generalize and extend the COARDS conventions](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/build/ch01s04.html)"
* [ISO 19111:2019, Geographic information â€” Referencing by coordinates](https://www.iso.org/standard/74039.html)
* _TODO: More!_

::: {.notes}
When a dataset follows a combination of one or more common standards, GIS practitioners and tools can accurately parse information about CRS, date/time, etc.

## Tools for introspecting metadata

* `ogrinfo`/`gdalinfo`: CLI & Python
* `xarray`: Python
* `ncview`: GUI
* Panoply: GUI
