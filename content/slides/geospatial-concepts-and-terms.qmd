# Data

::: {.notes}
Data is actual measurements.

For example, at location (X, Y), the albedo is 39%.
:::


## Vector data

* Point
* Line
* Polygon

## Vector attributes

Attributes add additional data to a geospatial element

* A point representing a weather station may have a `temperature` attribute
* A polygon representing a state may have a `population` attribute


## Raster data

* Continuous
* Categorical

## Categorical raster data

## Raster data considerations

* Interpolation
    * Use "nearest neighbor" with categorical data, or there will be "smudging" between
      categories.
* _TODO: What else?_
* _TODO: consider moving this discussion to day 3? This is an operation that is more
  aligned with the goal of preparing data for a specific use case._


## Other data types

We won't focus on these:

* Point cloud
* _TODO: What else?_


# Metadata

Data about data

::: {.notes}
Metadata is "data about data", and is how standards-compliant data files
"self-describe".

For example, this data is in "North Polar Stereographic" projection.
:::


## Projection & Datum {.smaller}

* Both datum and projection are important to describe spatial locations.
    * The term "projection" is often used to describe both datum and projection.
    * Prefer "Coordinate Reference System" or "Spatial Reference System".

* **Datum**: A representation of an ellipsoid that best matches an area of interest.
    * `WGS84` is a common global datum.

* **Projection**: ...
    * "Geographic" projection indicates latitude/longitude
    *


::: {.callout-note}
Even latitude/longitude coordinates need metadata (datum), particularly when the
location data is of a high precision.
:::


::: {.notes}
_TODO: Define and differentiate datum and projection_
_TODO: Find a diagram!_
:::


## Geospatial metadata concepts

* Provenance
* Temporality (date & time related to the phenomena being measured/represented)
* "Missing/No Data" and other flags
* ...


## _TODO: More!_

_TODO_


## Metadata standards

* CF conventions for NetCDF data
* _TODO: More!_


## Tools for introspecting metadata

* `ogrinfo`/`gdalinfo`: CLI & Python
* `xarray`: Python
* `ncview`: GUI
* Panoply: GUI
