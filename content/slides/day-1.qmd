NOTE: The background image is specified twice as a hack. Just specifying
`background-image` does not result in the image being part of the output bundle.

TODO: Once we have Quarto 1.2 (waiting on conda-forge
https://github.com/conda-forge/quarto-feedstock/pull/3), credit the background image by
overriding the title slide template partial and pass in an "aside" property, e.g.:
    aside: "Background image from NSIDC IODMS1B dataset"

Which would populate an `<aside>` tag:
    $if(aside)$
      <aside>$aside$</aside>
    $endif$
