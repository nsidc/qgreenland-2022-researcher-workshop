## What tool should I use?

The best one for the job. Explore your ecosystem!

* [GDAL tools](https://gdal.org/programs/index.html)
* Python: Rasterio, Shapely, Xarray, GeoPandas, and more!

::: {.notes}
You may recognize this slide from the "data inspection" deck.

Tool selection is context-dependent.

Command-line tools are especially useful for getting a quick answer.

Language-specific tools are good for automations or research code. These
examples use Python because that is what we are most familiar with, but explore
your preferred ecosystem and you will find equivalents.

# Transformation concepts {.smaller}

It's important that different datasets are compatible with each-other prior to analysis.

* All datasets should be in the same projection and datum
* Rasters should be "co-registered": matching grids
* Understand your transformations! Some can be "lossy"
* Optional: Don't keep data you don't need

::: {.notes}
Raster "co-registration" means multiple datasets have the same grid resolution and
orientation.

"Lossy" transformations can not be reversed. Potentially lossy operations include
reprojection, resampling, and conversion between raster and vector.
:::


## Reprojection

`gdal_warp`, `ogr2ogr`

![Reprojection (via [PyGIS](https://pygis.io/docs/d_vector_crs_intro.html))](https://pygis.io/_images/d_reprojection_example.jpg){.center}

::: {.notes}
When reprojecting, we always use geographic coordinates as an intermediate step.
:::


## On-the-fly reprojection

* Useful, but costly especially for large datasets.

* **Could cause unexpected results**: Is your tool acting on reprojected data or source
  data (what's actually on disk)?

* [Learn more about how QGIS does on-the-fly reprojection](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/training_manual/vector_analysis/reproject_transform.html?highlight=reprojecting#basic-fa-on-the-fly-reprojection)

::: {.notes}
On-the-fly reprojection is reprojection that's done implicitly; some GIS tools will use
OTFR to do an analysis between two datasets, and some other GIS tools will do OTFR to
facilitate visualization (e.g. QGIS). It's possible reprojection is happening without
your knowledge.

With OTFR, some choices are likely being made for you: Interpolation algorithm,
re-sampling algorithm, etc. Therefore, when doing analysis, know your tools! For most
analyses, it's helpful to ensure all datasets are in a common projection/datum.

In QGIS, OTFR is automatically enabled; all layers will be reprojected to the chosen
project CRS.
:::


## Reprojection pitfalls {.smaller}

Reprojection is typically lossy!

* When raster data is warped, data points are not mapped 1:1.
* Vector reprojection only affects vertices / points.

::: {.notes}
<!-- alex disable colors -->
* Once you have reprojected your data once, you can not necessarily go back to the
  original projection and get the same result. Think about pixel interpolation: it's
  impossible to mix two colors and then reverse the process. It's also impossible to
  know the spatial relationship of the original two colors (which was on the left, and
  which was on the right?). You can estimate, but you can not _know_.
<!-- alex enable colors -->

* When reprojecting vector data, the points move, but the edges are still straight lines
  between the points, even if they should logically be curved after the reprojection.
  You will lose topological information; e.g. a point could be inside a polygon
  prior to reprojection, and outside the polygon after.
:::


## Raster data considerations

_TODO: incorporate this slide into the surrounding presentation. This was taken from the geospatial concepts slide deck_

* Interpolation
    * Use "nearest neighbor" with categorical data, or there will be "smudging" between
      categories.
* Reprojection
    * Reproject only once, if you have to. Data values in the output grid are
      estimated from the input using an interpolation technique like 'nearest
      neighbor' or 'bilinear', potentially resulting in a loss or transformation
      of information in the input grid.


:::{.notes}
Raster reprojection results in resampling of the input grid to a new, output
grid (e.g., using interpolation techniques like 'nearest neighbor', 'bilinear',
etc.). Data values stored in the original grid are transformed to accommodate the
geometry and spatial positioning of the output grid.

_TODO: consider incorporating this image of interpolation techniques (maybe crop to
bottom half of image?)

## Reprojection pitfalls {.smaller}

Weird things happen at the edges!

<!-- alex ignore invalid -->
* Vector geometry can become invalid.
* Raster data can show a "seam" where edges are warped together.

![A "seam" along 180 degrees longitude in QGreenland's Natural Earth basemap](/_media/qgreenland_ne_reprojection_seam.png)

<!-- TODO:
* Consider manufacturing an example, e.g. make a raster with 3x3 grid, then calculate a
  polygon matching the shape of each pixel in that grid. Finally, reproject both: This
  will show how the edges of the old pixels don't match the edges of the new pixels.
* Consider how we could visualize vector geometry invalidating during reproject.
--->

::: {.notes}
<!-- alex ignore invalid -->
* Vector geometry can become invalid after reprojection. Imagine a shape in
  polar stereographic projection which crosses the anti-meridian. Reprojecting
  that to EPSG:4326 would require splitting that shape in two.

* Raster data can have a barely-visible "seam" after reprojection. For example,
  data in EPSG:4326 has edges at the antimeridian, and when reprojecting to
  EPSG:3413 those edges have to meet somewhere, and at that location you may
  see a seam. You can see these types of artifacts in Google Earth.

## Resampling

`gdalwarp`

Raster grids will not always align, even in the same projection & datum.

![Resampling - different origin (via [PyGIS](https://pygis.io/docs/d_vector_crs_intro.html))](https://pygis.io/_images/Raster_diff-orientation.jpg)

::: {.notes}
It's important to correct this problem before analysis so that you can be sure that
your computations across datasets will be successful.

## Subsetting (clipping)

`gdalwarp`, `ogr2ogr`

Consider doing a subset _first_. Don't waste time and computing power doing analysis on
areas you don't care about!

![QGreenland's Natural Earth 2 basemap without subsetting. QGreenland's area of interest
is the tiny circle in the center!](/_media/qgreenland_ne_no_subset.png)

::: {.notes}
Reprojection is expensive. If you subset first, it will take much less time! You may
want to consider doing a performance-motivated subset, then reprojecting, then
subsetting again in the new projection to get your final area of interest.
:::


## Conversion

`gdal_rasterize`, `gdal_polygonize.py`, `gdal_contour`

Does your data provide a suitable representation for your analysis?

::: {.notes}
For example, if you are trying to determine the area of a region or whether two phenomena
intersect, raster may not be a suitable representation. Similarly, if you are trying to
calculate an average scalar value, e.g. temperature or ice sheet thickness, over an
area, vector may not be a suitable representation.
:::

<!-- TODO:
* Do an example of rasterizing categorical vector data; show what happens when
  you interpolate incorrectly. Make this a data scenario. Add categories to data
  scenarios to separate transformation scenarios from metadata scenarios.

### Spatial interpolation

(grey lines). (b) Bed topography calculated from subtracting the interpolated ice
thickness from the GIMP surface elevation DEM. A in Figure 2b highlights the subglacial
overdeepening where major water rerouting

::: {.notes}
Disregard image (b); In image (a) we can see IceBridge flightlines represented in gray.
These flightlines are taking continuous measurements of ice thickness underneath the
airplane, so there are no measurements where the plane has not flown. Here a process
called "kriging" is used to estimate ice thickness in between measurements.
:::


## Conversion: Raster to vector

![QGreenland's Heat Flux layer (raster) with contours overlaid](/_media/qgreenland_heat_flux_contours.png)

::: {.notes}
You may want to do this for:

* Clumping regions of same value, e.g. contours.
* Clumping regions with similar aggregate value, e.g. find region shapes that each
  contain ~1000 people.
* Calculating the shape of an anomalous region and analyzing other attributes of that
  region.
* Convert a categorical raster image into vector regions.
:::


## General transformation pitfalls

* Some metadata in the source data may be carried over to the output. Use tools like
  `gdalinfo` or `ogrinfo` to inspect your metadata before publishing.

::: {.notes}
* This can result in good metadata *or* outdated metadata. For example, we have that
  issue with the BedMachine data produced for QGreenland. We can `gdalwarp` a BedMachine
  dataset to WGS84 and observe that the `mapping#` namespace continues to specify "polar
  stereographic" projection. On the plus side, citation and other metadata which we want
  to keep was also pulled over. This means you may need to do some manual metadata
  management when you apply transformations. `gdalwarp` has a `-nomd` flag to prevent
  metadata copying, but this can strip away useful metadata!
:::

<!-- TODO:
Integrate this metadata carryover pitfall into an example of transforming a raster; e.g.
reformat a NetCDF and then show the carried-over metadata, especially any fields that
are now wrong. Demo how to fix that?

# Application

## Data scenario: Raster needs reprojection

[Link](/content/exercises/data-scenarios/raster-needs-reprojection)

Review solution at
`content/exercises/data-scenarios/raster-needs-reprojection/solutions`.

::: {.notes}
* Review the scenario on the website by clicking the link in this slide.
* Point out the ambiguity of the scenario is typical of a real collaboration. We will see
  later that we don't have the information we need and will need to re-evaluate our
  solution.
* Open the notebook in JupyterHub; Repository is checked out at `/shared/QGreenland/.`.
  Notebook is at `content/exercises/data-scenarios/raster-needs-reprojection/solutions`.
* If anyone asks about interpolation done on zoomed-out interactive plot outputs, point
  out that `imshow` can take `interpolation='nearest'` argument to eliminate
  interpolation when not at 100% zoom.
