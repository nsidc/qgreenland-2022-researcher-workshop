## Breakout: Data analysis with JupyterLab

* Pick someone to "drive" with a screen share. Please rotate this responsibility!
* Run the example notebook from the "Intro to JupyterLab" discussion.
* Use your JupyterLab instance to inspect your group's chosen dataset. Try a few
  different methods!
    * Use `ogrinfo`, `gdalinfo`, `ncdump -h`, `ncinfo`, `xarray`, ??? in
      a Jupyter Notebook.
    * Include Markdown cells to tell a story: explain what each computation is
      doing, and what your group learned from the results of each computation.
* Commit and push your notebook to GitHub.
