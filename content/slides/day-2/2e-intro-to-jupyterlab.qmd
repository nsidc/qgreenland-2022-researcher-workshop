# Intro to JupyterHub

## Intro to JupyterHub

* CryoCloud
    * JupyterHub: <https://hub.cryointhecloud.com>
    * Website: <https://book.cryointhecloud.com>

* Log in to CryoCloud JupyterHub with your GitHub username
    * Important: select a _small_ server!
    * Your JupyterLab is dedicated, _not_ shared!

* _Please log out at the end of each day using `File > Log Out`!_

::: {.notes}
* JupyterHub is a system for creating many JupyterLabs, e.g. for classrooms
* JupyterLab is not shared!
    * Other attendees can't see your files (except those in "shared" dir)
    * Your computations won't slow down anyone else's
* Log out at the end of each day to save on cloud costs.
    * Any files you've created will remain next time you log in.

## What can I do in my JupyterLab?

* Terminal
    * `conda install <package>`
* Desktop / QGIS
    * Has access to the files in your JupyterLab
* Notebooks (more on next slide...)


## Jupyter Notebooks

* A tool for [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
    * Showing your work
    * Tracking provenance
    * Telling a story
* See also:
    * Quarto
    * JupyterBook
    * _TODO: Others?_


## JupyterLab demo

* Walk through running an example notebook and viewing its output in QGIS?
    * _TODO: Generate the example notebook._
    * _TODO: Maybe programmatically generate a random distribution of points over an
      area in Greenland (e.g. use the extent of "Greenland coastlines 2017" layer as the
      x/y extents for random-number generation, then filter those random coordinates
      using the "Greenland coastlines 2017" layer)._
    * _TODO: Maybe filter the "Place names database" layer by:_
        * Random sample
        * Maximum of a particular attribute
