# Intro to JupyterLab

## Available tools

* Notebooks (more on this later...)
* Terminal
* Desktop / QGIS
    * _TODO: Prior activities require use of QGIS; introduce this earlier? e.g.
      JupyterHub intro early in workshop, come back later to introduce Notebooks?_


## Jupyter Notebooks

* A tool for Literate Programming
    * Showing your work
    * Tracking provenance
    * Telling a story
* See also:
    * Quarto
    * _TODO: Others?_


## JupyterLab demo

* Walk through running an example notebook and viewing its output in QGIS?
    * _TODO: Generate the example notebook._
    * _TODO: Maybe programmatically generate a random distribution of points over an
      area in Greenland (e.g. use the extent of "Greenland coastlines 2017" layer as the
      x/y extents for random-number generation, then filter those random coordinates
      using the "Greenland coastlines 2017" layer)._
    * _TODO: Maybe filter the "Place names database" layer by:_
        * Random sample
        * Maximum of a particular attribute
