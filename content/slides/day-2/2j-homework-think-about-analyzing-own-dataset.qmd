## What analysis could you perform on your chosen dataset?

Spend some time thinking about what analysis you would like to perform on your group's
chosen dataset.

* Consider the other layers in QGreenland. How can you use them with your dataset to
  answer a question?

* Are there analyses you could perform that would result in a new and unique dataset
  that could be integrated in QGreenland?

* Share your ideas with your group in the GitHub Discussions for your repository.
