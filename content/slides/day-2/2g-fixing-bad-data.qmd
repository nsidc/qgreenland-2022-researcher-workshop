# Discussion: Fixing "bad" data

* _TODO: second draft_
* What can I do if my data still does not look right?
    * Metadata may be incorrectly documented; contact data producer?
    * It's possible nobody knows how to fix the problem
    * _TODO: briefly mention techniques like georegistration, bias correction?_
* Tools: `ogr2ogr`, `gdal_translate`, `gdal_edit.py`

::: {.notes}
Worst-case scenarios:

* If the metadata is incorrectly documented, there may be no way to "guess" the correct
  configuration. Contacting the originator may be the _only_ way forward. 
* It's possible nobody living knows how to fix the problem.
