## üíæ Select a dataset of interest

* Select one or more datasets that are not currently a part of QGreenland you

  dataset, consider choosing one from an established data repository such as
  the [Arctic Data Center's QGreenland data
  portal](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/portals/QGreenland/Data) or the [National
  Snow and Ice Data Center](https://nsidc.org/data/explore-data). If you are
  still struggling to choose a dataset, select one from this list (TODO: link to
  list).
* Use these [guidelines](dataset-selection.md) to pick an appropriate dataset.
* [Post a short description of the dataset(s) you have identified and why it
  interests you](https://github.com/nsidc/qgreenland-2023-researcher-workshop/discussions/new?category=dataset-ideas)
