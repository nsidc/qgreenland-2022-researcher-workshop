# Dataset selection guidelines

When selecting a dataset for this workshop, please consider the following
guidelines.  It is OK if you can not tick all these boxes.

Please keep in mind that while we are [interested in
suggestions](https://github.com/nsidc/qgreenland/issues/new/choose), inclusion in
QGreenland is not guaranteed for your selected dataset!

## Criteria

In order of importance, we are looking for datasets that are:


### Geospatial

Data that could be visualized on a globe. Preferably 2D data, as we don't plan to get in
to point-clouds (e.g. a DEM is OK because it's geolocated in 2 dimensions, even though
it measures height).


### Greenlandic

The data should be relevant to Greenland.


### Interesting

Data you are excited about!


### Imperfect

Data that has some usability problems. It is OK if you can not load it in QGIS.


### "New"

Data that is not already present in QGreenland.


### Manageable in size

While we will be using cloud processing tools, we are not going to explore
techniques for working with "big data" in this workshop. Please try to choose a
dataset <5 GB in size.


## Having trouble choosing?

If you are struggling to pick a dataset, consider choosing one from an established data
repository such as the [Arctic Data Center's QGreenland data
portal](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/portals/QGreenland/Data) or the [National Snow and
Ice Data Center](https://nsidc.org/data/explore-data). If you are still struggling to
choose a dataset, select one from this list.
