# Dataset selection guidelines

When selecting a dataset for this workshop, please consider the following guidelines.
It's OK if you can't tick all these boxes.

In order of importance, we're looking for datasets that are:


## Geospatial

Data that could be visualized on a globe. Preferably 2D data, as we don't plan to get in
to point-clouds (e.g. a DEM is OK because it's geolocated in 2 dimensions, even though
it measures height).


## Greenlandic

The data should be relevant to Greenland.


## Interesting

Data you're excited about!


## Imperfect

Data that has some usability problems. It's OK if you can't load it in QGIS.


## "New"

Data that is not already present in QGreenland.
