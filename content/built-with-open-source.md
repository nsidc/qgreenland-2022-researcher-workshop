# ❤️  Built on open-source tools

You may notice some rough edges in the workshop contents, for example tables of
contents that don't fit on the page. The website and slides are generated by
open-source tools, some of which are undergoing rapid development (e.g. Quarto).

## 📜 [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Manages workshop content and its history.


## 🐙 [GitHub](https://github.com)

Tools for developing in public and community interaction.

Because we iteratively developed all
[workshop content](https://github.com/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher.github.io)
in GitHub, we had powerful review and feedback tools at our fingertips.

Workshop attendees also used GitHub to share deliverables.


#### [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

GitHub Actions were configured to perform automated checks (spelling, considerate
language) against our workshop materials and to trigger the Quarto build process
whenever our default branch changed.


#### [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

With GitHub Pages, we automatically published the output of Quarto builds by GitHub
Actions to <https://qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher.github.io>, ensuring our website was
always up-to-date.


#### [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions)

GitHub Discussions was utilized by attendees to post introductions, ask for help, and
record the outcomes of small group discussions.


## 🇲 [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

Text format for representing workshop content.


## 🌐 [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

Markdown-based technical authoring tool which compiles our workshop content for
publishing.

Quarto builds this website and all the content on it, including slide decks. Quarto
supports computational elements, and these are handled by Jupyter. Compilation to
various output formats (slides, websites, PDFs, ePubs, and much more) is handled by
Pandoc.

Quarto is open source and owned by [Posit](https://posit.co/), the makers of the
[RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/). Although the Quarto
project is in early stages, the maintainers are doing a great job of engaging with the
community and even quickly fixed
[some](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4514)
[bugs](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4606)
we reported during the development of the workshop.


## 📃 [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

Library for converting content between different formats.


## 📽️ [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com/)

Displays beautiful web slides.


## 🪐 [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

An ecosystem for interactive computing.

Hands-on activities are supported by the [CryoCloud
JupyterHub](https://cryointhecloud.com/).
