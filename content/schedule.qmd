<!-- TODO:
* Homework? Think about how you could perform an analysis with your chosen dataset
* Is the lecture/discussion part of the morning too long? Can we break it up with
  exercises?

* Intro to GitHub
    * Add slide on Zenodo
    * Add Jupyter Notebook from day 1 to personal repo

* Discuss geospatial data transformations
    * Concepts
        * Reprojection
            * _TODO: consider discussion about characteristics of common
              projections and why you might want to use one over another._
        * Resampling
        * Subsetting
        * Conversion (raster <-> vector)
        * _TODO: Consider discussion about information loss from common
          transformations (reprojection, resampling, datatype conversion
          (raster<->vector))_
    * Tools / Techniques
        * QGIS Processing Toolbox (brief mention, participants should be
          familiar with this from the [beginner tutorial
          series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znKeiV3-Amo&amp;index=5)).
        * gdalwarp, ogr2ogr, ...
        * Python (rasterio, shapely, Xarray, pyresample, PyQGIS, ...)
        * _TODO: create notebook examples for various tools_
    * Pitfalls
        * Some metadata in the source data may be carried over to the output,
          resulting in outdated metadata. For example, we have that issue with
          the bedmachine data produced for QGreenland. We can `gdalwarp` a
          bedmachine dataset to WGS84 and observe that the `mapping#` namespace
          continues to specify "polar stereographic" projection. On the plus side,
          citation and other metadata which we want to keep was also pulled over. This
          means you may need to do some manual metadata management when you apply
          transformations.

### Day 3

| Time          | Activity         |
| :------------ | :--------------- |
| 09:00 - 09:15 | [Daily overview](materials.qmd#day-3-overview) |
| 09:15 - ??:?? | Symbolizing geospatial data in QGIS |
| ??:?? - ??:?? | üå∂Ô∏è **Break** |
| ??:?? - 13:00 | Group dataset analysis |

: {tbl-colwidths="[25,75]"}

<!-- TODO:
* Symbolizing geospatial data in QGIS
    * Colormaps (15 minutes)
        * `cmocean` as a strong default
            * How to add `cmocean` to QGIS (_TODO: add link to video_)
        * Common mistakes in choosing a colormap
            * Colorbrewer (a useful tool, but very specific use-case)
            * Jet / rainbow
        * Colormap analysis with `viscm`. _TODO: consider utilizing
          <https://github.com/nsidc/colormap-analysis>_
    * Representing vector data attributes (10 minutes)
        * Point markers
        * Color
        * Size
        * Labels
        * Scale dependent rendering
    * Accessibility related concerns?
    * Exporting layer settings as QLR

* Exercise: Plan an analysis for your dataset
    * Choose an idea for an analysis involving your dataset.
    * Using a Jupyter Notebook:
        * Outline what steps you need to take to perform the analysis.
        * Estimate the time it would require to develop your analysis.
        * If there are barriers to performing your analysis, document what they
          are and how you could overcome them given the necessary resources
          (time, additional datasets, etc.).
    * Commit the notebook and push it to GitHub.

* Exercise: Analyze your dataset
    * If possible, begin to perform your group's chosen analysis.
    * If your analysis is not possible, consider one of the following activities:
        * If your group's dataset is not "QGreenland-Friendly", make it so.
            * EPSG:3413
            * Use the QGreenland "Greenland-focused boundary" layer to subset the
              data (`Reference/QGreenland` boundaries in the QGreenland **Layers
              Panel**).
            * Make sure the data is GeoTIFF or GeoPackage.
        * Data analysis scenario
            * _TODO: consider additional data/analysis scenarios that groups can try if
              they have the time / do not have an analysis for their dataset._

* End of workshop group report
    * Tell us about what you learned
    * Provide a brief overview of your analysis / ideas for future analysis with
      the dataset you chose.

## Day 4 - Office hours

Use this time to discuss continued learning opportunities, for example:

* If we run low on time:
    * QGIS symbology
* Advanced Git/GitHub usage
* Continued dataset analysis
* Publishing derived data

<!-- TODO:
What other modules can be moved to day 4 if we're running low on time?
