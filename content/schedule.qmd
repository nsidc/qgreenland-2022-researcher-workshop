#### Content to be scheduled

* Fixing common metadata/data formatting problems
    * Walk through data scenario(s)?
    * Group activity: data scenario(s)?

<!-- TODO:
* Add slide on Zenodo to "Intro to GitHub" module
* Add Jupyter Notebook from day 1 to repo during "Intro to GitHub" exercise
-->


#### TODOs

* Is the lecture/discussion part of the morning too long? Can we break it up with
  exercises?

#### Content to be scheduled

* Symbolizing geospatial data in QGIS
<!-- TODO:
    * Colormaps (15 minutes)
        * `cmocean` as a strong default
            * How to add `cmocean` to QGIS (_TODO: add link to video_)
        * Common mistakes in choosing a colormap
            * Colorbrewer (a useful tool, but very specific use-case)
            * Jet / rainbow
        * Colormap analysis with `viscm`. _TODO: consider utilizing
          <https://github.com/nsidc/colormap-analysis>_
    * Representing vector data attributes (10 minutes)
        * Point markers
        * Color
        * Size
        * Labels
        * Scale dependent rendering
    * Accessibility related concerns?
-->

* Discuss geospatial data transformations
<!-- TODO:
    * Concepts
        * Reprojection
            * _TODO: consider discussion about characteristics of common
              projections and why you might want to use one over another._
        * Resampling
        * Subsetting
        * Conversion (raster <-> vector)
        * _TODO: Consider discussion about information loss from common
          transformations (reprojection, resampling, datatype conversion
          (raster<->vector))_
    * Tools / Techniques
        * QGIS Processing Toolbox (brief mention, participants should be
          familiar with this from the [beginner tutorial
          series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znKeiV3-Amo&amp;index=5)).
        * gdalwarp, ogr2ogr, ...
        * Python (rasterio, shapely, Xarray, pyresample, PyQGIS, ...)
        * _TODO: create notebook examples for various tools_
-->

* Exercise: Plan an analysis for your dataset
<!-- TODO:
    * Choose an idea for an analysis involving your dataset.
    * Using a Jupyter Notebook:
        * Outline what steps you need to take to perform the analysis.
        * Estimate the time it would require to develop your analysis.
        * If there are barriers to performing your analysis, document what they
          are and how you could overcome them given the necessary resources
          (time, additional datasets, etc.).
    * Commit the notebook and push it to GitHub.
-->

* Exercise: Analyze your dataset
<!-- TODO:
    * If possible, begin to perform your group's chosen analysis.
    * If your analysis is not possible, consider one of the following activities:
        * If your group's dataset is not "QGreenland-Friendly", make it so.
            * EPSG:3413
            * Use the QGreenland "Greenland-focused boundary" layer to subset the
              data (`Reference/QGreenland` boundaries in the QGreenland **Layers
              Panel**).
            * Make sure the data is GeoTIFF or GeoPackage.
        * Data analysis scenario
            * _TODO: consider additional data/analysis scenarios that groups can try if
              they have the time / do not have an analysis for their dataset._
-->

* End of workshop group report
<!-- TODO:
    * Tell us about what you learned
    * Provide a brief overview of your analysis / ideas for future analysis with
      the dataset you chose.
-->


## Day 4 - Office hours

_TODO: What are the hours? How to join office hours?_

Use this time to discuss continued learning opportunities, for example advanced
Git/GitHub usage.
