# Curriculum

## Goals

* Build a shared familiarity with standard/open tools, formats, and practices
* Create a more collaborative/open environment for researchers
* ...?


## Ideas

* Include a break (or two) in each day's schedule. Break every 60m? 90m? How long to
  break?


## Schedule

### Day 1

#### Goals

* Learn what determines the quality of a dataset
  * What are common data formats?
  * What are common metadata standards?
  * What are some common practices that lead to problems interacting with data?
* Learn how to fix "bad" data
  * What can I do if my data still doesn't look right? (e.g. it's possible nobody living
    knows how to resolve the problem, metadata may be incorrectly documented and you may
    need help from the data producer, briefly mention techniques like georegistration,
    bias correction)
