Answer the following questions:

* What determines the quality of a dataset?
* What are common data formats?
* What are common metadata standards?
* How can I fix "bad" data?
* What can I do if my data still doesn't look right? (e.g. it's possible nobody living
  knows how to resolve the problem, metadata may be incorrectly documented and you may
  need help from the data producer, briefly mention techniques like georegistration,
  bias correction)


#### Activities

* Discussion on geospatial data quality (60m)
  * What makes a "good" data format? (e.g. self-documenting, FAIR)
  * Examples of "good" data formats (e.g. GeoJSON, GeoPackage, GeoTIFF, NetCDF, ...)
