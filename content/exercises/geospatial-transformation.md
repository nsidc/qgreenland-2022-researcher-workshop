_TODO: Choose one of these scenarios. Re-use the other in a later exercise?_


## üíΩ Data scenario

Please select one of the following data scenarios and develop a Jupyter Notebook to
resolve the scenario.

* [Vector reprojection](data-scenarios/vector-needs-reprojection/index.md)


## ‚ù§Ô∏è Cross-compatibility

Work with a second team. Trade datasets with each-other! Your team will work to make
your data more analysis-compatible with the other team's data. This means:

* Data should be in an open format with correct geospatial metadata
* Data should be in the same projection
* Data should be in the same format if possible
* Rasters should be co-registered (in the same projection and resolution and
  orientation)
