# Data Scenario: Missing NoData value

::: {#file-listing}
:::

You download the dataset `bambgrl_dem_5km_corrected.tif` [from
NSIDC](https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0092/versions/1) and open it in QGIS. You
observe that ocean values all appear black. You use the **Identify tool** to
verify all the black values are the same: `-0.1`.

At this point, you're not sure what this represents, so you consult the [user
guide](https://nsidc.org/sites/default/files/nsidc-0092-v001-userguide.pdf) to find this
important phrase at the top of page 4:

>DEM values of -0.1 m represent ocean

Since you don't need this dataset to represent ocean locations (and it covers up your
basemap), you decide you'd like to encode this ocean value in the metadata as a NoData
value.
