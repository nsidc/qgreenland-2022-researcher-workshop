# Data Scenario: Missing Metadata

You download a dataset from {some landing page} which doesn't load in QGIS.

The included data file is not a real example of data from {some landing page}; it's been
modified to present a challenge.


## TODO

* Mock a data file with all metadata removed.
* Choose an appropriate dataset for this exercise. Should have a good quality landing
  page which describes all the metadata the participant will need to reconstruct.
