Your team needs a DEM of Greenland for a global analysis processing pipeline that
requires a WGS-84 geographic projection (`EPSG:4326`). Your team selected
the included modified datafile based on Bamber Greenland DEM
[-@bamber_2001_greenland_dem].

Reproject this data file to `EPSG:4326` using bilinear interpolation.
