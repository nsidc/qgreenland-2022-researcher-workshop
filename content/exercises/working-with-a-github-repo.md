::: {.callout-warning}
We request that everyone use the GitHub browser interface. If you choose not to,
be prepared to support your group if issues like merge conflicts arise. See
[this
page](https://book.cryointhecloud.com/how_tos/background/git.html?highlight=authenticate#authenticating-with-github)
for details on using Git in CryoCloud.
:::

We have **pre-created GitHub repositories for each group**. The URL for your group's
repository will be
`https://github.com/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/group-{your-group-number-spelled-out}`,
e.g. `https://github.com/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/group-two`. You can find
all repositories
[here](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/repositories).

Everyone in your group should have access to write to your repository. **If you have any
issues with permissions, please contact an organizer!**


## üìÇ Add some content to your team repository

* Add a `README.md` file:
    * List your group members by name.
    * Identify the dataset your group has chosen to explore.
    * Add your notes describing your dataset from the [Select a
      dataset](./select-a-dataset.md) exercise.
* Add the notebook your group produced during the
  [Data Inspection](./data-inspection-with-jupyterlab/index.md) exercise to
  your repository.
* [Turn on GitHub
  Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/quickstart#enabling-github-discussions-on-your-repository)
  for your group repository. Use this space for asynchronous discussions within your
  group during (or after!) the workshop.

### ‚ú® Create your personal profile repository

If you have time after completing the group-work component of this exercise,
work as individuals to create your own personal profile repositories.

Follow [GitHub's
instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme#adding-a-profile-readme)
to create a profile repository with a profile `README`.

You may want to use your introductory post to [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/categories/introductions)
to inspire the contents of this `README`.

When you are done, you should be able to navigate to `https://github.com/<your-username>`
and see your new content displayed!


## ‚è±Ô∏è Finished early?

### üáø Enhance your team's repository

* If you have extra time, enable
  [Zenodo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content)
  for archiving and generating DOIs for your repo!
* If you still have more time, set up a [citation
  file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files)
  for your repository, listing all members of your group.
