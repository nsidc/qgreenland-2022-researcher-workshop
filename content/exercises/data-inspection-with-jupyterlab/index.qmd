## üîç Inspect some data

* Create a new Jupyter Notebook to inspect your group's chosen dataset.
* Use `ogrinfo`, `gdalinfo`, `ncdump -h`, `ncinfo`, `xarray`, or a tool of your
  choice in a Jupyter Notebook. Try some different methods. Find information
  like:
    * Projection
    * Extent (e.g. corner coordinates / edge values)
    * Grid shape
    * Number of features
* Include Markdown cells to tell a story. Explain what each operation is doing,
  and what your group learned from the results of each operation. Make it easy
  to come back to the notebook and find important attributes of your dataset.
