## ‚ù§Ô∏è  Make the data work together

Your team will work to make your data more analysis-compatible with the data from the
second team you worked with in the previous exercise. This means:

* Data should be in an open format with correct geospatial metadata
* Data should be in the same projection
* Data should be in the same format if possible
* Rasters should be co-registered (in the same projection and resolution and
  orientation)

Build this transformation process out in a Jupyter Notebook that guides the reader
through each step.

 
## üóÉÔ∏è Add the notebook to your team's GitHub repository

Using the GitHub interface, add this notebook to your team‚Äôs repository. Give it a
