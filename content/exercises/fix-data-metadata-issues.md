Pick someone to "drive" with a screen share. Please rotate this responsibility!


## ❤️‍🩹 Resolve any data/metadata issues with your group's dataset

Review the information you gathered in the [Data inspection with
JupyterLab](./data-inspection-with-jupyterlab/index.md)
exercise. Develop a Jupyter Notebook to fix any issues that you discovered.

Consider:

* Can the data be opened and viewed in QGIS?
* Is the CRS information correct?
* Is the data in an open and interoperable format?
* Is there a `NoData` value that needs to be encoded in the metadata?

If your chosen dataset has no issues to resolve, see the `Finished early?`
section below.


## 🗃️ Add the notebook to GitHub

Using the GitHub interface, add this notebook to your team's repository. Give it a
useful name!

## ⏱️ Finished early?
