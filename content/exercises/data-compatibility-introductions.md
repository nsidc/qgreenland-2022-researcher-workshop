## 💬 Introduce your dataset to another team

You'll be paired with another team in a breakout room. Take turns introducing your
dataset to the other team. Make sure you mention:

* Coordinate Reference System
* Raster or vector?
* What is being measured and what are the units?
* What challenges did you have to overcome to make this data usable?

Please reference or demonstrate the exploratory notebooks you created in previous
exercises when introducing your dataset.

Take notes about the other team's dataset; you'll need them later!


## 🗃️ Add your notes to your team's GitHub repository

Later on, you'll use these notes to create a new Notebook.
