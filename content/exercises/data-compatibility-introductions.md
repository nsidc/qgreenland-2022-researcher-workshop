## üí¨ Introduce your dataset to another team

You will be paired with another team in a breakout room. Take turns introducing
your dataset to the other team.

:::{.callout-note}
If you are still struggling to use your team's chosen dataset in QGIS, consider
using one of the [example datasets](/content/example-data/).
:::

When introducing your dataset, make sure to mention/show:

* Coordinate Reference System
* Raster or vector?
* What is being measured and what are the units?
* What challenges did you have to overcome to make this data usable? For
  example, did you need to edit the dataset's metadata? Change it's file format?
* Where does the data reside on disk? Show the other team where you put your
  data in the `shared-public/QGreenland-Researcher-Workshop/` directory.
  * If you have modified versions of your data from one of the other exercises
    (e.g., [Fixing an issue with
    data/metadata](https://qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher.github.io/content/exercises/fix-data-metadata-issues.html)),
    let the other team know which one is the "most ready" for them to use. For example,
    if your dataset lacked a CRS and you added one, provide the data with the
    added CRS to the other team!
* Show the other team how to open your data in QGIS.

Please reference or demonstrate the exploratory notebook you created in the
[Data inspection with
JupyterLab](./data-inspection-with-jupyterlab/index.md) exercise and any
changes to the data/metadata you made in the [Fix data/metadata
issues](./fix-data-metadata-issues.md) exercise when introducing your
dataset.

Take notes about the other team's dataset; you will need them soon!


## üóÉÔ∏è Add your notes to your team's GitHub repository

Later on, you will use these notes to create a new Notebook.
