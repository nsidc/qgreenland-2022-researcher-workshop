## 💬 Introduce your dataset to another team

You will be paired with another team in a breakout room. Take turns introducing
your dataset to the other team. Make sure you mention:

* Coordinate Reference System
* Raster or vector?
* What is being measured and what are the units?
* What challenges did you have to overcome to make this data usable? For
  example, did you need to edit the dataset's metadata? Change it's file format?

Please reference or demonstrate the exploratory notebook you created in the
[Data inspection with
JupyterLab](exercises/data-inspection-with-jupyterlab/index.md) exercise and any
changes to the data/metadata you made in the [Fix data/metadata
issues](exercises/fix-data-metadata-issues.md) exercise when introducing your
dataset.

Take notes about the other team's dataset; you will need them soon!


## 🗃️ Add your notes to your team's GitHub repository

Later on, you will use these notes to create a new Notebook.
