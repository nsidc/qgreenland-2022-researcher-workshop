# Make a GitHub repository (40 minutes)

* Create repository.
    * _TODO: how should the repository be named? Consider mentioning the difficulties
      around naming. Guidelines?_
* Add a `README.md` file:
    * Introduce your team members by their GitHub user IDs
    * Identify the dataset your group has chosen.
    * Mimicking the demo repository created in the previous activity, create a section
      for the metadata and data.
        * _TODO: Link to demo repository_
* Turn on GitHub Discussions for your group repository. Use this space for asynchronous
  discussions within your group during (or after!) the workshop.


## TODO

* _TODO: Create a dedicated organization for workshop participants to use, grant
  privileges to create repositories._
* _TODO: Think more about what exactly we want people to do in the last 20 min_
* _TODO: Should there be a second deliverable here? A git commit? A GitHub
  discussion? Some kind of reflection on the day?_
