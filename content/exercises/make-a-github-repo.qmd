# Make a GitHub repository (40 minutes)


## âœ¨ Create repository for your group

Pick a person in your group to "drive" a screen share and do the following
steps:

* Your repository should be named with convention: _TODO: Convention!_

::: {.callout-warning}
It's expected that most participants will work in the GitHub browser interface.
If you prefer to work at the CLI or use branches, we expect that you will
support your group if any issues like merge conflicts arise.

## ðŸ“‚ Add some content

* Add and commit the notebook produced during the _Data Inspection_ module to
  your repository.
* Add and commit a `README.md` file:
    * Introduce your team members by their GitHub user IDs
    * Identify the dataset your group has chosen.
    * Mimicking the demo repository created in the previous activity, create a
      section for the metadata and data.
        * _TODO: Link to demo repository_
* Turn on GitHub Discussions for your group repository. Use this space for
  asynchronous discussions within your group during (or after!) the workshop.


## TODO

* _TODO: Figure out how permissions will be handled._
* _TODO: Should there be another deliverable here? A GitHub discussion? Some
  kind of reflection on the day?_
