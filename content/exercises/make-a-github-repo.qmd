# Make a GitHub repository (40 minutes)


## âœ¨ Create repository for your group

Pick a person in your group to "drive" a screen share and do the following
steps:

* Your repository should be named with convention: _TODO: Convention!_

::: {.callout-warning}
It's expected that participants will work in the GitHub browser interface. If
you prefer to work at the CLI or use branches, it's expected that you will
support your group if any issues like merge conflicts arise.
:::

* Add a `README.md` file:
    * Introduce your team members by their GitHub user IDs
    * Identify the dataset your group has chosen.
    * Mimicking the demo repository created in the previous activity, create a section
      for the metadata and data.
        * _TODO: Link to demo repository_
* Turn on GitHub Discussions for your group repository. Use this space for asynchronous
  discussions within your group during (or after!) the workshop.


## TODO

* _TODO: Figure out how permissions will be handled._
* _TODO: Should there be a second deliverable here? A git commit? A GitHub
  discussion? Some kind of reflection on the day?_
