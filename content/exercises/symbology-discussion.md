# üí¨ Discuss symbology choices

You will be paired with the same team as in the [Data compatibility introduction exercise](exercises/data-compatibility-introductions.md). Take turns showing
the other team your symbology choices and explain why you made the choices you
did.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Finished early?

Spend the remaining time discussing other workshop topics. Is there anything you
still have questions about? What do you want to do more research on? Have you
thought of new ideas for how to analyze your data? Take turns sharing your
thoughts and asking questions of the rest of the group. Record ideas and
questions in GitHub discussions ([click here to create a new post in the "Show
