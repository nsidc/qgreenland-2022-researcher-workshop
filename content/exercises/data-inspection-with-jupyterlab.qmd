# Data inspection with JupyterLab (30 minutes)

Learn about a dataset and its metadata.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Get set up

* Pick someone to "drive" with a screen share. Please rotate this responsibility!
* Run the example notebook from the "Intro to JupyterLab" discussion.
* Change the color of the Greenland shape in the last cell of the notebook and
  re-render.


## üîç Inspect some data

* Use your JupyterLab instance to inspect your group's chosen dataset. Try a few
  different methods!
    * Use `ogrinfo`, `gdalinfo`, `ncdump -h`, `ncinfo`, `xarray`, ??? in
      a Jupyter Notebook. Include information like:
        * Projection
        * Extent (e.g. corner coordinates / edge values)
        * Grid shape
        * Number of features
    * Include Markdown cells to tell a story: explain what each operation is
      doing, and what your group learned from the results of each operation.
* Commit and push your notebook to GitHub.
