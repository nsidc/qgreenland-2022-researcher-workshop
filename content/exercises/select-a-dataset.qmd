# Select and analyze a main dataset (15 minutes)

## ðŸ¤” Select a dataset as a group

Use [these guidelines](/content/prerequisites/dataset-selection.md) to select a dataset
that your group will focus on going forward in this workshop.

:::{.callout-note}
You are not stuck with the dataset you choose! Your group can use a different
dataset at different times if it's more appropriate for a specific exercise.
:::


## ðŸ§­ Explore your dataset

Choose a note-taker and record the results of these steps in whatever way you feel
comfortable. We will come back to these notes later!

::: {.callout-warning}
Do not take notes in Zoom chat; they will disappear.

* Try to open your data in QGIS. Is that possible?
* Identify key attributes of the data/metadata ("Unknown" is an expected answer)
    * Data type (raster, vector, etc.).
        * For rasters: is it categorical or continuous data? What are some of
          the categories that are present or what does the continuous variable
          measure?
        * For vectors: what geometry type(s) are included and what do they
          represent? What are some attributes?
    * File type (XLSX, CSV, Shapefile, NetCDF, etc)

## Follow-up exercise 

Time allowing, switch roles and explore one or more other datasets individuals
in the group have identified that were not chosen as the 'main' group dataset.
