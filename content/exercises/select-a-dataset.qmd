* Try to open your data in QGIS. Is that possible?
* Identify key attributes of the data/metadata ("Unknown" is an expected answer)
    * Data type (raster, vector, etc.).
        * For rasters: is it categorical or continuous data? What are some of
          the categories that are present or what does the continuous variable
          measure?
        * For vectors: what geometry type(s) are included and what do they
          represent? What are some attributes?
    * File type (XLSX, CSV, Shapefile, NetCDF, etc)
