# Dataset analysis plan

## ðŸ’¬ Discuss your group's ideas for analysis

Come to a team agreement on the analysis you'd like to perform. Choose an
analysis that will be at least partially achievable during the workshop. You
may want to continue the analysis post-workshop.


## ðŸ““ Create a Jupyter Notebook

* Outline what steps you need to take to perform the analysis as Markdown
  cells.
* Estimate the time it would require to develop your analysis. Write this down
  towards the top of your notebook.
* If there are barriers to performing your analysis, document what they
  are and how you could overcome them given the necessary resources (time,
  additional datasets, etc.). Write this down towards the top of your notebook.
* Commit the notebook and push it to GitHub.
