Choose someone in your group to take notes.

Reflect briefly on
[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and
[CARE](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/6397b363b502ff481fce6baf/1670886246948/CARE%2BPrinciples_One%2BPagers%2BFINAL_Oct_17_2019.pdf)
principles. Are there any thoughts or observations you would like to raise in a
larger group discussion?

Topics to consider:

* ðŸ¤— FAIR & CARE & me: how do FAIR & CARE principles relate to your research or goals.
* ðŸ’½ Your chosen datasets: Discuss how one or more of the datasets your group
  members has chosen relate/conform to FAIR/CARE principles.

## Post notes in GitHub Discussions

Post your group's notes in [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/qgreenland-workshop-2023-researcher/discussions/new?category=fair-care).

Make the title of your discussion your group name. For example, if you are group
1, use the title `group-one`.

We plan to use these responses to drive a short full-workshop discussion after
the break.
