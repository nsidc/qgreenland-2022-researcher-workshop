# Group work expectations

* Be conscious of power dynamics
* Treat everyone as a peer
* Expect to teach and learn from your team members

*Participation in group work is required for receiving your stipend! If you feel like
your group is having a participation issue, please contact an organizer.*


## Group roles {.smaller}

Within breakout groups, please identify individuals for each of these roles:

* **Time keeper**
* **Note taker**
* **Presenter**: Presents work products to the main group
* **Equity monitor/moderator**: Ensures that your group is hearing all voices
* **Driver**: Shares screen while working on a collaborative product

Some may have multiple roles. We recommend that you rotate these roles at least once a day.
