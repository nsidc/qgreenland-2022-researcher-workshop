## Impressions

* JupyterHub is a powerful educational tool. With the release of JupyterLab 4 and
  real-time collaboration at `v1.0.0`, I can envision JupyterHubs becoming even more
  useful, for example enabling real-time collaborative technical support, or for small
  group exercises to be done in a shared notebook.
* The CryoCloud JupyterHub performed flawlessly and did everything we need. I was
  surprised how smooth it was for attendees from around the globe to use QGIS in a
  virtual desktop environment.
* Our attendees were very engaged, and this made the workshop very rewarding and lots of
  fun to administrate.


## Changes we'd like to make

* The material we developed technically fit in the schedule, but we wanted to provide
  more time for attendees to do hands-on work. Either increase the time for the
  material, or cut some material.


## Tips and tricks

* Let people join their own breakout rooms; trying to predict what e-mail people
  will join Zoom with and pre-configuring breakout rooms turned out to be a time
  sink. Inevitably, some will join from their phone, not sign in, etc. resulting in
  spending time manually setting up breakout rooms.


### Run of show

We created run-of-show documents in Google Docs that we could collaboratively edit to
manage team checklists and roles.
