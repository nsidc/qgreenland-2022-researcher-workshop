## Impressions

* JupyterHub is a powerful educational tool. With the release of JupyterLab 4 and
  real-time collaboration at v1.0.0, I can envision JupyterHubs becoming even more
  useful, for example enabling real-time collaborative technical support, or for small
  group exercises to be done in a shared notebook.
